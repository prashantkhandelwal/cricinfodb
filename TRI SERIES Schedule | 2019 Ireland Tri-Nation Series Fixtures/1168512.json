A thoroughly professional chase from them, notwithstanding a couple of dismissals to uncalled-for shots. Each of their top six got to at least 20, and two of them got past the half-century mark. That's pretty much what you need when you're chasing 248. Not much of a wicket threat from any of the West Indies bowlers barring Ashley Nurse, who dismissed each of the three left-handers at the top of the order. Sheldon Cottrell seemed to get into a bit of rhythm by the end of the innings, which was a bit of a positive, but the two allrounders, Raymon Reifer and Fabian Allen, didn't have very good games at

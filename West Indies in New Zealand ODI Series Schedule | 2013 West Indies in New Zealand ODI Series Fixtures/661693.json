We needed a big win and thanks to everyone who played a big part and played hard to represent their country. Charles and Powell were going through a tough time, but it was important me and the coach backed them. They have done great things for us in the past, and the way Powell started put pressure on NZ straight away. Then Edwards came in at No. 3, under pressure, and took the opportunity by getting a maiden century. I can't single out anyone, but it was a great team effort. We always want competition. The coach says that we should make more options available. This will put us in a great position, and getting world-class players like Chris Gayle for the T20s will make a big difference. It was a decision by the management team (to open the bowling). Unfortunately Rampaul missed out in order to strengthen the batting, so we wanted to make sure we had a strong batting unit. Russell just came up and said I should take the new ball. It is important for Russell to be back in the one-day team."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Brendon McCullum, New Zealand captain</b>: The West Indies boys came out today and put on a splendid performance.

We have a huge series coming up against India. We have put some good performance so far in the series. We are getting there as a one-day unit, and we are seeing an emergence of new talent. Anderson in Queenstown was sublime, and then the bowlers have chipped in as well. Looking forward to the T20 series, and hopefully we can turn up and put on a performance we know we are capable of doing."},{"type":"HTML","html":"So the West Indies officially beat New Zealand in the fifth ODI at Hamilton by 203 runs, a real shellacking that by the visitors.

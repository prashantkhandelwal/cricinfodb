The dew didn't come in, so that perhaps worked in our favour. Tough decisions to drop Anderson and Ronchi. We have played on different surfaces so that affects selection.

The new ball under lights still came on but as it got older it became difficult. The Nos 5 and 6 are quite new, they will learn their own way. Some will play big shots, some will take it deep. Once they have played 15-20 games, they will figure out what works for them. Cricket has changed, people like to play big shots. It is important to not tell them to stop playing the shots; you don't want them to go into their shells. They played their shots when the ball was in their area. They will learn after they have played 15-20 games. Usually there is dew at this time of the year, and in Indian cricket the moment you talk about dew you want to bowl first.

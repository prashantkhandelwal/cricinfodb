The switch there in the middle was very good. Perhaps we could have got 5-10 runs more.

When he's in that sort of form, you have to be 100% perfect. He'll punish you otherwise and that's what happened. The luck didn't go our way too a couple of times.

Good spells from Phehlukwayo and Pretorius, who're fighting it out for the allrouner's spot. Tahir started poorly but returned to begin the procession.

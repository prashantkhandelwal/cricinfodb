We knew there would be a bit of nibble [batting first] but we thought we could build a platform for the lads at the end. When it comes to this stage, games come thick and fast, it's more of a mental thing, to put yourself back on track.

Adil today, it shows the threat legspin poses, turning it both ways, he's very threatening. [Mark Wood?] First game back it's important to get overs under your belt, manage the expectation, important he builds up momentum to the CT. [Rashid?] He's had a tough winter playing against high-calibre opposition, so to come back and show calmness and composure was great. I think we have a stiffer test with the SA series coming up, it's part and parcel of our preparation. Take nothing away from Ireland, they have the ability to beat any side, so we need to start again at Lord's.

England wouldn't get much credit for anything other than a thumping - and that's what they have served up, Ireland dismissed for a paltry score in 33 overs and the chase mopped up before lunch. The whole match lasted just a wee bit beyond 50 overs, and Ireland have some work to do if they are going to save face in the second match of the series at Lord's on Sunday.

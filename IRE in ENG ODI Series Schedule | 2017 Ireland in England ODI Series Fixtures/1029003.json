Two very efficient victories although they had to dig a little deeper at stages today. It was an improved display from Ireland with bat, ball and in the field even if a gulf still remained. England's innings was set up by Morgan and Root then finished off by Bairstow and Rashid. Ireland made a flyer with the bat before Jake Ball and Liam Plunkett slowed them, followed by Root's career-best with the ball. England's players (most of them) now head back to the Royal London Cup for a few days - Morgan and Billings back to the IPL - then they have a training camp in Spain ahead of the three-match series against South Africa. Their Champions Trophy campaign begins on June 1. For Ireland, it's back home for an important triangular series involving New Zealand and Bangladesh. A chance for more top-level cricket.

If I tell you we had the believe we'd win, I'd be lying. But cricket is a funny game, wickets fall and scoreboard pressure is bad to have. When the Fizz got two wickets, we thought we had a chance. I think Ireland are a quality side, they need to play more in different conditions and do better. They do well here, need to come to Asia and do well there too. If you have a good bowling attack, it's easier to captain. Very happy with our fast-bowling unit. One or two are injured but we still have a solid bowling attack.

Yet another close loss for Ireland, hard not to call it a choke. They needed 51 off nine overs with seven wickets in hand. Then Shanto's first over, the 42nd of the innings, accounted for Harry Tector's wicket. Tector took the positive option when he was tied down but he couldn't do it at that point and then the Fizz took over and he couldn't be put back in the bottle. There were a couple of paddles that cost Ireland big: wickets of Tucker and Adair went to Bangladesh as bonuses.

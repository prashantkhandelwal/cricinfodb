The pair never let the required run rate go out of hand and kept Bangladesh in the game. But once they both fell - with Shanto having scored a fantastic, maiden ODI ton - the game was open. Ireland squeezed in some economical overs and took it to the last over. Adair almost did it by dismissing Mushfiqur, only for it to be a waist-high no-ball. And rest, as they say, is history.

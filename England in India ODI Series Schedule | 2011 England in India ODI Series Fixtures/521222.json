We know that you can lose wickets in cluster, we seem to have lost 10 there in a cluster. Credit to the way they bowled, and we played a couple of poor shots. There have been a few positives out of this series, Steven Finn's bowling for example.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Ravindra Jadeja</b> is the Man of the Match, for his runs, and especially for his wickets. \"There was turn in the wicket, so I was just trying to bowl line and length, stump to stump,\" he says. \"There was a little bit of dew on the ground, but we kept drying the ball after every delivery. I've been working hard in the nets.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>MS Dhoni</b> is the Man of the Series. \"It was, to some extent, an ugly looking wicket. You were never really set, and it was difficult to score runs. We were fortunate to score 270 on a wicket like this, 240 to 245 was in our mind. We had a bit of a partnership in the middle, and later on with Ravindra Jadeja and Praveen Kumar. I want to stay till the end, and whatever's in my area I try to hit to the boundary. If it's not in my area i just try and get a single. They got off to a very good start, and I was just waiting for it to spin, that's why i delayed taking the powerplay. We've really improved in the fielding department too.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"That's all from your commentary team today.

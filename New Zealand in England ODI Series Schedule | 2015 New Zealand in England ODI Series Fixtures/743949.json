We need to be a bit better. We lacked a bit of accuracy with the ball and against good players there is no room for error. Trent is a big loss but we're still confident with the attack we've got, we just weren't good enough. I was confident with 349 on the board, I didn't think the wicket would play as good as it did, they got off to a great start and we weren't able to drag them back. Throughout 50 overs you are always going to have a lull, we had that in the Powerplay but still, I thought we had enough runs up. Eoin is a champion bloke and in the form of his life, credit to him. We came here to try to win this series and I'm sure there's one more cliffhanger to come.

I thought our bowling was reasonable, we tried to be flexible and change our plans and angles but we got together after drinks and said if we can keep them to around 340 we can chase that down. Woody and Finn were outstanding. The carefree attitude is helping my batting, concentrating on the process rather than the result and I've really enjoyed going up to No. 4. I still think the style is most important than the result now up at Durham. It's very encouraging at the moment.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<br><br>"},{"type":"HTML","html":"There was almost nothing New Zealand could do. They are missing Trent Boult and Corey Anderson but could they actually have done much against batsmen in such form and conditions stacked in their favour? You have to simply say they didn't get enough runs and that poor second Powerplay - just 23 runs scored - has probably cost them here. 375 has to be considered a score to be confident with based on the evidence in this series. Once again we've had a cracking wicket and a truly memorable game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<br><br>"},{"type":"HTML","html":"This chase was given a rollicking start by Alex Hales and Jason Roy, their best alliance of this series so far and then Joe Root and Eoin Morgan took over with a wonderful partnership, continuing the superb attitude to batting England have taken in the series.

The way he is swinging the ball, he is a rare talent. And in the last couple of years, we have seen him go from strength to strength. We tried all sort of things to help him get five but it couldn't. But the confidence is there and we can see in the way he is running. He is working on a few tricks. Not given too much thought about [NZ].

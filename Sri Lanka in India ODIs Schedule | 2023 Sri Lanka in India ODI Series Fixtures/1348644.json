fielding creates confusion and a wicket. Use of feet from Nuwanidu once more. Flicks it uppishly to Gill's right at midwicket. He dives full length but it bounces just short of him.

Since the last one year, I have been trying to back my strength and not think much. Whenever I get my chance, I just think about performing well. I am enjoying my bowling a lot. The team combination matters, so I just try to give my best whenever I get my chance. I bowl the faster in the IPL and T20Is also to give the batter one run. So I just did that here also. I have worked on my batting a lot of late. Same with the fitness. Whenever I get time, I go to the NCA. So thanks to the trainers there. That's one thing I have tried to do in the last one year.

In the hindsight, it will be nice to have a left-hander in the top order but guys who are being given the chance have got a lot of runs in the last one year. Ideally, we would like to have a left-hander but we know the quality of our right-handers and are quite comfortable with that at the moment. We will have a look at the pitch for the third ODI, and another ODI series is coming up as well. So we will see if we need to make any changes.

When Sri Lanka started, I thought it was a 280-300 wicket. But our bowlers bowled really well to keep them to 220-odd. But they put up a good fight, got early breakthroughs to put us under pressure. But I had a good partnership with Shreyas and Hardik. We always try to find a way to win, and it was nice to cross the line in the end. [On different approach against Hasaranga today] In Guwahati, the openers put the pressure on the opposition. Then your mindset is to attack, doesn't matter who is bowling. Today we lost early wickets, so it was important to soak the pressure. If we are chasing 280-300, then we would attack him. But today there was no need. The good thing about batting at No. 5 is you don't have to rush. You can take a shower, put your feet up and watch the game. But I always think what team needs of me. If you can read the situation when you go in, it helps you and team. Batting at No. 5 has helped me understand my game better. At No. 5 you have to face spin straightaway; I like ball coming onto the bat but Rohit has been pretty clear that he wants me to bat at No. 5, so that's what I am trying to do."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>8.47pm</b> A hard-fought win in the end, and India have sealed the series.

Chasing 216, India didn't have a great start, they lost early wickets but despite that the run rate was never an issue. That allowed KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya to take their time. Hardik fell with the target still 55 runs away but Axar hit a couple of boundaries to ease the nerves.

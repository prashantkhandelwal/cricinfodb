We're 5-1 down, that's the way the game goes sometimes. If you've got seven matches it gives one side a great opportunity to gain momentum and get on top of the other. I'm still confident we've got a great side, we had a great Ashes series and no-one can take that away from us. This series hasn't really helped us nail down our World Cup XI as there've been so many injuries, but it's the same for Australia.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Nice to get a hundred,\" says <b>Jonathan Trott</b>. \"It's more memorable when you win the game.

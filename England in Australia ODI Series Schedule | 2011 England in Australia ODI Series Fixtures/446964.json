After a wobble chasing England's modest total David Hussey with Steve Smith firstly and then John Hastings have steered them to a comfortable victory. Australia's bowlers, led by Brett Lee and backed up by Xavier Doherty, set up the victory. England didn't do much right today and now need to win an unlikely four games in a row if they are to avoid their first loss in an ODI series since losing to Australia 6-1 after the 2009 Ashes. Andrew McGlashan will tell you all about it in his <a href=\"/the-ashes-2010-11/content/current/story/497909.html\" target=\"new\">bulletin</a> which will be ready shortly.

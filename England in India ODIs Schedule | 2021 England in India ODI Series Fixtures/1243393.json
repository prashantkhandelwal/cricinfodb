There's always a next time. When I wasn't playing, I was thinking how I can give to the team. I was being a good 12th man (laughs), serving water. In my head, though, I was quite positive.

Team showed great character and intensity. As I've mentioned in the past as well, we promote players who have intent and back their skills. Special mention to Shikhar's innings as well. Didn't get much after the first T20I. KL as well, back among the runs. So we want to back people who will do a selfless job. It's a healthy competition between everyone for every slot. We have 2-3 players available for every slot. The management has done these discussions with senior players as well. We are on the right path. A special mention to Shikhar again. His body language was amazing when he wasn't playing. He was motivating players, running with extra stuff like water. Today he deservedly got the result he achieved. Made a very important contribution. You saw it was tricky first up and the openers had to start off that way. In that context, his innings was very important since he batted the tough overs. His contribution was better than what the scorecard was. Yes, could be (was England subpar). When I was batting, I told Shikhar that between 31-40 I'd look to take the bowlers on. We lost a few wickets and there was a brief pushback but Krunal and KL then took it away. If I had stayed with Shikhar around that 40 over period we could've got 350.

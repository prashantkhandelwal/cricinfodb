You have to really praise Tendulkar for taking this decision in his stride, and not do the equivalent of snatching a cap from an umpire. This is really abysmal umpiring from Akhtar.

uninterested, but he gestures to his square-leg colleague Javed Akhtar... Is he asking him whether that carried to the keeper? Low chance for Mongia after Moody drove with an angled bat at a full one outside off stump. It goes low to Mongia, inches above the ground, and he appears to take it cleanly enough, with both gloves, but he barely appeals, and that might be because Moody hasn't edged it. It's not very clear, but if he has edged it at all, it's come right off the toe-end of the bat. The decision goes up to the third umpire, and I suppose all he's been asked is whether the ball carried.

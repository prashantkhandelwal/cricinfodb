They batted positively either side of a long rain break, especially on the resumption, and benefited from the D/L calculation as they'd only lost one wicket before the rain. The target was tough for South Africa and they needed a good start which never came as Graeme Smith's problems continued (although he could have saved himself with a review). Pat Cummins starred again while Xavier Doherty impressed with a good spell. Overall, plenty for Australia to be happy about and much for South Africa to ponder ahead of the next match in Port Elizabeth. We'll be back in less than 12 hours to bring you coverage of India against England but, for now, from Andrew McGlashan and Liam Brickhill - who deserves a special mention for his efforts during that rain break - it's goodnight."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":{"team":{"id":3,"objectId":3,"scribeId":3,"slug":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","longName":"South

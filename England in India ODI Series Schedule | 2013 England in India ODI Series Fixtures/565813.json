Initially, when I and Raina had a partnership, we thought let us look for 240 or 250, and then when we are settled, lets target 260, we ended up getting 15 more. To go and play [the next game] at my city [Ranchi] will be very special. The crowd here was really superb, not to forget the heat and the humid weather.

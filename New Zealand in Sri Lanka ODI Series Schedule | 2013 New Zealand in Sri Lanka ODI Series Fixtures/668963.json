Latham set it up for us and a number of guys did their job with the bat. Nice to finish it off the way we did. We have always had belief and backed our skills to do the job, but at the end of the day we have to come on the field and play winning cricket. Yeah I think we are leaking a few too many four balls and we are bowling slightly better than we did in the first game. We bowl well initially but then we let go off the pressure with a bad ball. We have to fix that up ahead of Dambulla. It's remarkable how much the game has changed over the last 3-4 years. Saw the games in India and who would have thought that 320-340 was a par score. It's up to the bowlers to go back to the drawing board and make new plans. There are opportunities for guys to step up, but as I said before, we are here to play winning cricket. The guys try really hard to put a result on the board. I am really enjoying the captaincy.The Game is a lot faster than I expected. Thought I could just stand at third man or fine leg (chuckles). It was a good result tonight."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka captain</b>: Yea actually the batters did everything right. We did well to get the score we did, but then we got complacent after that. Most times batting second it would work for us. But 200 runs to get in 23 overs a night game, our bowling should have done the job, but we got complacent and the bowlers were making errors after the 10th over. I went for the best bowler (Rangana Herath) for the final over and would have chosen that anyways. The seniors came to the party once again, especially after losing first wicket in the first over. Unfortunately the bowlers could not pull through for us today. Pretty happy with the way I am going and pretty happy with the way I batted in the last game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Tom Latham, Man of the Match</b>: It is obviously very pleasing to get the win and go to Dambulla 1-0 nil up. After losing to Bangladesh 3-0 was tough. Wecame here with a young group. Nice to win the second one so really happy about that. The new rules certainly help when it comes to chasing those big scores. Big guys can clear the ropes when they want."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Now quotes from the <b>match presentation</b>"},{"type":"HTML","html":"Hellooo, where did that come from! Nathan McCullum as done an ABdV here! Sri lanka would have thought the game was in their pocket at the start of the last over, but out from nowhere, Nathan McCullum has pulled out a blinder. 32 from 9 balls. This was not an easy target for an inexperienced attack and they lost a chunk of wickets at the start. But a super innings by Latham first, then Ronchi, then the clean finish. For a moment, it looked like Malinga had pulled it back for Sri Lanka, but it was not to be. And we thought that rain was going to be the winner. New Zealand go 1-0 in the three-match series."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Shiju R: \"I bet that is Brendon playing in Nathans jersey\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Michael T: \"Un-be-liev-a-ble.

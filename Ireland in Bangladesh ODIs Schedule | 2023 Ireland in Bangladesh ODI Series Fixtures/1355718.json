The first wicket came via a run out before Litton and Shanto dug in adding 101 runs off 96 balls. Ireland did stage a comeback with three quick wickets but Mushfiqur Rahim and Towhid Hridoy's stand of 128 off 78 balls completely took the game away from Ireland. They leaked runs both side of the stumps and the Bangladesh batters made merry. Mushfiqur slammed 14 fours and two sixes in his century to set up a record score.

For us, it's about keeping rotating the strike and taking the odd boundary here and there. it's about taking the game deep. We knew if we were there at the end, we would win. (On fitness) For me, it's about putting in a 100 percent all the time. As a kid, I loved fielding and diving around.

It's another challenge to bounce back from here. (On T20 plans) International cricket is always priceless. Experience in any format helps you in other formats. It's about being out there and playing good international cricket. It's an opportunity for these young middle order players to stand up to outstanding bowlers and play a match-winning knock. (On batting at 4) We've had this discussion in the past. Because of the way KL has batted, we have tried to have him bat up in the lineup. We might have to think about this. Every now and then, it's about putting people up there and testing them. People need to relax and not panic.

At no stage, did we want the momentum to go towards the opposition, I was middling the ball well, and I said I would be the one to take the chances. Days like this, if it comes off, it looks good. If we had lost a wicket in the middle, it would have been different. (Bowling attack faced) Australia always comes up with a good bowling attack.

Also, shades of that successful chase by Australia in 2001, that was engineered by Michael Bevan, the great chase-master of <i>his</i> generation!"}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":30907478,"id":30907478,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":47.03,"oversActual":47.3,"overNumber":48,"ballNumber":3,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":1,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":"2020-01-19T15:33:31.000Z","modified":"2020-01-19T15:33:42.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":51454,"bowlerPlayerId":51367,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":285,"totalInningWickets":3,"predictions":null,"title":"Hazlewood to Pandey","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Prabhan: \"A good sports Sunday coming to an end in another 10 minutes.

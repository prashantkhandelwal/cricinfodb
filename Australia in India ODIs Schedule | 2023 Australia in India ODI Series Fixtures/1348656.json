I was just looking to bowl in good areas. Also I was getting a little bit of turn, so I thought I need to bowl in the right areas and the wicket will do the rest.\"<br><br><b>Hardik Pandya</b> says, and this is not verbatim: \"We were under pressure in both the innings, but we kept our composure, and found ways to come out of those situations. When we got the momentum our way, we didn't let it go. I am really proud the way we played today. Jaddu did what he was supposed to do coming back after eight months away from ODIs. I enjoyed my bowling and batting, would have loved to finish it off, but the way KL and Jaddu batted, it was calming to those watching from the outside.\"<br><br><b>Steve Smith</b> says, and this is not verbatim: \"We weren't expecting this when we rocked up here. India bowled well this morning, but we probably left a few out there. Had we got 250, we would have had some match. Mitch started really well. He took the game on early, and got a few away. Through the middle we lost a few too many wickets. We were always one partnership from them beating us, and Jadeja and Rahul did that. 260-270 was par. It was offering a fair bit for the seamers. The ball swung pretty much throughout. We just needed to score more runs. If we had got a partnership and take it deeper. It was not to be, and credit to India.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>8.48pm</b> That Rahul has been interviewed already probably means he will not be the Player of the Match. There are four other performers left: Shami, Jadeja, Marsh and Starc. The last of them can probably be left out for now.

Well done Jaddu, can't wait to see you in Yellow. \""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>8.43pm</b> KL Rahul says, and this is not verbatim: \"Three wickets had gone down, and Starc was swinging the ball. He is dangerous when it is moving. I gave myself some time, not go searching for runs. I was fortunate I got a couple of boundaries early on. Whoever I batted with, the talk was that there is a bit of help in the wicket, but we can't go into our shell and look to play out a certain bowler. We wanted to run hard, we wanted to put the loose balls away. The minute a left-hander walked in, I got a few loose balls too. That happens to the best of bowlers. Jaddu batted beautifully, he is in great form, and he knows what to do in those situations. When we started off, I didn't think the pitch was going to help the bowlers that much. The minute Shami came back in, he did wonders. Any team that wants to win needs to pick wickets in the middle over. I enjoyed my keeping. When there is bounce, I enjoy it. When it is slow and slow, it is challenging physically.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>8.38pm</b> An early end to the night with a little over 75 overs of cricket played. The pitch had some spice in it, but Mitch Marsh made it look much easier when he batted. It was a truly sensational innings of 81 off 65. However, Australia perhaps misread the conditions because of that, and kept looking for quick runs once Marsh got out. Also possibly the composition of their attack - just three full-time bowlers - pushed them to go harder. Shami and Siraj bowled beautifully once Jadeja got Marsh out. Had Australia got to 250, this would have been a thriller because the ball did more for them in the first 15-20 overs under the lights. In the end, India didn't have the pressure of the asking rate, and KL Rahul took it upon himself to see India through from 16 for 3. Australia were left to wonder what if they had got 50 more runs or if they had an extra specialist fast bowler.

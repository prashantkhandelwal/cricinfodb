get out. Sleepwalking to his own demise but what a <i>smart</i> work from Sangakkara. Short  and outside off stump, Sehwag frees his arms and it flies down to thirdman. Sehwag walks across. The ball reaches Sangakkara. Sehwag is now very very near the crease. Sangka spots a opportunity, takes out his gloves and fires a throw at the non-striker's end. And what is happening there? Sleepwalking Sehwag has turned just before the crease, his feet on the line, and turns to see what's happening at the other end. The ball flies past him to crash into the furniture! And he is out! Referred upstairs and he is gone! Fab stuff from Sangka! Sehwag was playing so well, looking in control and there he combusts in a bizarre fashion."}],"fowOrder":3,"fowWicketNum":3,"fowRuns":118,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":17.1,"fowOverNumber":18,"ballOversActual":17.1,"ballOversUnique":17.01,"ballTotalRuns":118,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null}],"inningFallOfWickets":[{"fowOrder":0,"fowWicketNum":0,"fowRuns":6,"fowOvers":null,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":1,"fowWicketNum":1,"fowRuns":92,"fowOvers":11.6,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":2,"fowWicketNum":2,"fowRuns":106,"fowOvers":14.1,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":3,"fowWicketNum":3,"fowRuns":118,"fowOvers":17.1,"fowBalls":null}],"inningDRSReviews":[]}]},"smartScorecard":null,"bestPerformance":{"batsmen":[{"_uid":8197,"player":{"id":8197,"objectId":50431,"name":"LPC

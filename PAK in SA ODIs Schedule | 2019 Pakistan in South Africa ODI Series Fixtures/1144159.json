And it has cost Pakistan a wicket. But that's just a small blemish on a wonderful day out. They were hit by the absence of their regular captain Sarfraz. But stand-in captain Shoaib Malik's experience came to the fore. He rotated his bowlers well, packed tight fields, and made the batsmen earn every run. South Africa could only manage 164 of them. Pakistan's reply was as clinical a reply as there has been from them in recent times. It was thoroughly clinical but for that one moment of madness from Imam towards the end. Deserved to remain unbeaten after that effort.

You have to adapt to conditions and it is something we didn't do that today. Pakistan are playing really well - can't take that away from them for one second. We have to find a way where we can strike with wickets and also get ourselves in a position with the bat where we can put pressure. We were very disappointed in the game.

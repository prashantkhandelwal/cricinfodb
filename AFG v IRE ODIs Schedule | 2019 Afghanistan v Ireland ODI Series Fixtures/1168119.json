Andy Balbirnie was a major contributor again, anchoring the chase to perfection with 91-ball 68 to follow up on his match winning hundred earlier. But Paul Stirling was the star, his charge curtailed by a contentious lbw decision that he was visibly furious about. His 88-ball 70 brought Ireland within sniffing distance of the target and the middle-order did enough to take them home without much drama. The pitch certainly got better to bat on under lights, but Ireland still had a strong spin attack to contend with and they did so beautifully. Afghanistan would be disappointed but they've been in an experimental mode through the series, making three or four changes on an average to test their bench, leading into the World

Winning that set the tone for the one-day series. Our batsmen kept performing and our bowlers kept defending whatever totals were set. [On the positives] There are a lot of positives. Each and everyone took the responsibility in every game, especially Kusal Mendis. Good to see him back in form and doing well and winning the Man of the tournament. It is almost a team effort. The crowd has been amazing in Kandy and here, they were always behind us from the start. We will surely deliver more in future as a team.

We saw in that second game a big 170-run partnership from SL. That have been the differences. We got 40 and 50-run partnerships but not enough. We just need to maximise the middle overs.

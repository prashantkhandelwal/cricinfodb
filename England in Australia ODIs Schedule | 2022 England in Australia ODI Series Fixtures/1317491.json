href=\"https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_fielding_first=2;class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=amount;result=2;team=1;template=results;type=team;view=results\">heaviest defeat in ODIs</a>. A very convincing 3-0 series win for Australia who have been far more motivated and switched on. That is somewhat understandable from England's point of view, but they have still be disappointing, especially today. But they achieved what they really wanted from their time in Australia. What these results mean in the longer term remains to be seen, but Australia look to have some strong building blocks in place. Travis Head the biggest gain for them, continuing his outstanding ODI year. The World Cup in India will demand some different stills and the three ODIs there in March, after the Tests, should be a good indicator of where they stand. Probably wise not to judge England too harshly, but Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott will want to make strides on the tours of South Africa and Bangladesh next year. I'll bring you the presentations shortly.<br><br><b>Travis Head</b> is player of the match: \"It was nice. Haven't got many runs she [his daughter] was born. Nice to be back with Davey, our partnership has been nice so far. It was [about] trying to stay positive, rode my luck for 30-40 runs. We both play similar, try to take it on, and are very positive. We feed off each other, like attacking the bowling. Been a nice start.\"<br><br><b>David Warner</b> is player of the series: \"We played fantastic this series, England with the World Cup, these games are hard to get up for. We played exceptional cricket, the bowlers did a fantastic job and the batters tried to execute as well as we could. 2024 is a long way away, lot of cricket to be played, if I can keep fit, scoring runs and doing the best I can for the team, I might be here.\"<br><br><b>Jos Buttler</b> \"We tried our best, fell a long way short. Australia outplayed us in every department. Lots to be proud of, don't need a very long memory to remember the scenes here last week.\"<br><br><b>Pat Cummins</b> \"It's been fantastic, all three games. Everything has really clicked, the bowlers have all wanted to bowl and the batters have been fantastic. Good to finish it off here, that's just about the best ODI I've been a part of. That opening partnership, they came off and said the wicket was a bit tricky, we didn't believe them but it was really tricky out there. Roll out the same [pitch], all five Tests, would be lovely. Trav Head, the way he's stepped into Finchy's role, opening the batting in one-day cricket is so important. He's done it all three games. Bit more depth, saw Sean Abbott out there tonight, Ash Agar played a big part in a couple of games. Been great. Lot of this ODI is playing in week's time, we love playing in front of home crowds, best time of year for us. We can't wait.\"<br><br>Right, that just about wraps things up for tonight. It's been an odd, squeezed in series, but hopefully those of you who have joined us have still enjoyed it. Thanks for your company. We'll be back tomorrow with the start of the WBBL finals and then it's not long until the Test summer begins on November 30. But for now, from Gnasher and Karthik, it's goodbye."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[{"id":349579,"objectId":1345952,"slug":"pat-cummins-poses-with-the-series-trophy","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/349500/349579.jpg","width":1400,"height":933,"caption":"Pat

Full ball from Jadeja, Warner looked to sweep it with the turn, and got a top edge that took off into the Sydney sky. Raina runs back from square leg. Irfan runs in from deep fine leg. Like a silent movie, there was no calling between the two men, both transfixed on the orb in the sky. Irfan belatedly saw Raina hurtling towards him, and his eyes popped out in shock, but there was <i>still</i> no calling. Raina completes a superb catch and then they crash into each other. Raina inadvertedly punches Irfan in the chest, but he holds on to the ball tight. Both men are down. Irfan feels his chest gingerly as he goes off the field. A bit of a smile in there, which is good. Raina seems ok now. Great presence of mind to hold onto the ball through that collision.

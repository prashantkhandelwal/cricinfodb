He dived full length into the crease but has still been caught short by Maharoof's direct hit. Dilshan and Herath will be very relieved men, after they both dropped Watson. Warner pushed the ball on the leg side and ran a quick single, Maharoof sprinted to his left, picked up, turned around, and threw at the batsman's end. He could have attempted to run out Warner as well, but decided Watson had had enough let-offs. A badly judged run. Watson was watching the ball and I don't think he expected Maharoof to throw at his end because the bowler had to turn around and transfer the ball from left to right

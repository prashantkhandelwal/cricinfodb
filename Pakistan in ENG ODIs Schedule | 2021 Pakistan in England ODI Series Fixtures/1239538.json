Lewis and Brad are very capable batsmen, and their partnership gave us a good total, with the wicket offering a bit of seam.

The third ODI won't be a dead rubber entirely, because Super League points are still up for grabs, but the series is won, and England will be delighted with the performance of their second-string seam attack in particular. There was a bit of juice in this pitch, and all four of their seamers made life extremely difficult for Pakistan's batters in this chase of 248. Gregory finishes with three wickets to go with his 40 with the bat, and Saqib Mahmood was often unplayable with the new ball, bowling with four slips at times.

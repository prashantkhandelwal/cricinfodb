Bangladesh's batting is looking out of sorts against the accurate swing and pace bowling, their lower order (mainly Mithun) has saved them to cross a respectable 200 both times otherwise their batting hasn't clicked at all. And even while defending low totals, their bowling seems to lack that penetration or the threat a pace attack needs, especially in these conditions, to try and prepare for the World Cup. Bangladesh and New Zealand won't be playing more ODIs after this series until the global tournament in the summer. Not having Shakib for this series can't be the only reason for such a performance."},{"type":"HTML","html":"New Zealand will be feeling more confident about Guptill after the series loss against India.

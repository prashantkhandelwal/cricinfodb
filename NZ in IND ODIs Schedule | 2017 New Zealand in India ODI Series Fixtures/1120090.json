Fantastic bowling from Boult. Good length outside off, fifth-stump line, it's not wide enough for Dhawan to cut, and Dhawan feels he needs to play because of that previous delivery and with Boult getting the ball to hold its line. This one, though, pitches and swings further away, and Dhawan wafts at it needlessly. Gets a thick outside edge which flies at chest height to Latham's left.

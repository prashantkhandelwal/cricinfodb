Jason put us in a good position, but credit to Shahid Afridi. I thought 225 was gettable, but once again the batting crumbled under pressure. It is the lack of confidence. We have not been scoring runs. That plays its part. We really have to rally around each other and back ourselves and back our ability. There has been improvement. We didn't finish badly with the ball. Disappointed for the fans too. Hopefully it will be better on Tuesday.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"It was a much-needed performance,\" says <b>Misbah-ul-Haq</b>. \"Especially the way Shahid Afridi played. It is one of the more difficult pitches I have played on. It was seaming, it was stopping, it was really difficult to middle the ball. I thought if we could reach 200, we could fight. And Shahid helped me. On a pitch that it was difficult to middle the balls Shahid was hitting fours and sixes. Jason Holder bowled well. The fielding was wonderful. Everybody was charged up. Every bowler bowled well.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"I try hard and I back myself and I want to thank people back home,\" says <b>Shahid Afridi</b>, the Man of the Match. \"It is not time for me to just survive in the team, but to give a lot to the team. It was not easy to survive so I tried to stay positive. Whenever I got the ball in my zone I went for it. I knew Misbah was at the other end. I knew he would stay till the end, it gave me the confidence to go after it. Oh wow wow wow wow what a pitch it was for me to bowl. I just kept it simple, and it worked.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"What a comeback by that man Shahid Afridi. What a Sahibzada. What a Lala. Everybody congratulates him on a career resurrected. Afridi points to Mohammad Akram, the bowling coach, and says \"he is the man\". This could possibly be the greatest comeback in ODI cricket. This 7 for 12 is now the best analysis by a Pakistani, and the second-best of all, behind only Chaminda Vaas. On a pitch that the rest of the world struggled to go at three an over, Afridi scored at a strike rate 138. And not just for a few balls, but for 76 momentum-changing, game-sealing runs. And then those legbreaks. He just seems so much fitter. The drift is back, the dip is back. What a joy it is to welcome Afridi back. Now hope for some consistency, and wait for the presentation

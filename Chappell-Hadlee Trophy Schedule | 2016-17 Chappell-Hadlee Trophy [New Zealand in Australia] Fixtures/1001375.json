Until next time!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Steven Smith</b> - The catch wasn't a bad one. It was a nice way to finish. We have put up a pretty complete performance in all three games. We needed to improve after South Africa. The bowlers put in good performances. The guys from the top four going and getting hundreds and bowers sticking to plans has helped us turn it around. All three quicks bowled beautifully throughout the series. It was good to see Pat Cummins coming back and bowling fast and Starc too is returning after a while."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Kane Williamson</b> - There has been a player in the Aussie side who has contributed in every game. Pretty disappointing. We did want to show signs of improvement, which is why today's performance was especially disappointing. We would have had to bat well to chase down 264, but it was pretty gettable. I don't think we were smart enough with the bat today. Australia thoroughly deserved to win. I would also like to thank the support the Kiwis have had. We would definitely like to improve and we now look forward to the return series."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Warner</b> - It's a team performance. Credit to the bowlers for coming out and executing the plans. Us as batsmen, we had to relay the message and they did extremely well. My first coach of cricket until I was about 16 or 17 passed away, my condolences to his family. I would like to hope my form is getting better, but I need to keep hitting the nets and work harder."},{"type":"HTML","html":"David Warner is the Man of the Match and the Man of the Series."},{"type":"HTML","html":"So the final assessment reads like this - David Warner - 156; New Zealand - 147. Little else needs to be said. Australia complete a 3-0 sweep, and given how rough the last few months have been, this win must taste especially sweet. David Warner made all the difference between the two sides. On a pitch where the rest of Australia and all of New Zealand's batsmen struggled, Warner was on a different plane and struck at 121.87. Seventh ODI century of the year, second only to Tendulkar's nine in 1998 as far as most ODI centuries in a calendar year go. Unfortunately, he will not get a chance to try and break that record as Australia are done with ODIs for the year. But what a way to finish off 2016!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"Pat Cummins - Absolutely, it was actually a little tougher today. David Warner played an unbelievable innings and it feels great to finish 3-0. Can't wait to get out there and bowl a few deliveries. I think on a wicket like this, it's a bit slow and there is not going to be much boundaries, so we had to stop the singles, which is something we pride ourselves in doing. It seems like I am learning something every game. Each week is different and it feels great."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Travis Head - Fantastic. Great opportunity, the last three games. We've played fantastically, especially after the last couple of months we've had, it feels great to win. I feel in good touch. Probably did not sum up the conditions as well as I would have liked to. It was a slow wicket. Happy that I was able to help win the game with the ball as well."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Geoff Hoar: \"What another disappointing batting performance, yet another display of block bash batting with no attempt to rotate strike or play themselves in and build partnerships.

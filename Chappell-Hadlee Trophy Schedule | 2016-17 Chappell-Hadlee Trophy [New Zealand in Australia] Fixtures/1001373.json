David Warner made a typically bruising century to set things up along with Steven Smith before the supercharge from Mitch Marsh and Travis Head got them past 370. In the chase, this was all about Guptill v Australia. He threatened briefly, but once he fell, it was a steep task. As well as Neesham and Williamson played, the escalating asking rate meant they were always in danger of falling to one big shot. Once they fell, Australia had it easy.

Australia is one of the best side in the world, and at home they are the best side in the world. The death overs really hurt us, and Australia have been showing us how to build partnerships."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Steven Smith: 330, 340 was probably par. 380 was a big total. You needed a lot of things to go right if you need to chase it down. Warner set us up, Head and Marsh played well. It was a good batting deck, but the ball can reverse a bit in the night, and we have got some good quicks who bowl at good pace and tail the ball in. Cummins really switched it on today. He changed his pace at times, and he is quality prospect. We will hold the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy for six wickets before we head to New Zealand.

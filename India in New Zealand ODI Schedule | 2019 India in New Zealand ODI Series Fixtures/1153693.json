As is their wont, two from the top order, Rohit and Kohli today, set it up nicely and Rayudu, who had looked badly out of touch before the last ODI, batted with freedom, as did Dinesh Karthik, included instead of an injured Dhoni today. This makes it three series wins for India outside Asia in the last one year, starting with the hammering of South Africa, a closer series against Australia and another comfortable win here.

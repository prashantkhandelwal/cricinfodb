Slower balls and short balls, wide balls and full balls, but no yorkers. Bravo is having a torrid time with the ball, following a really pedestrian IPL. I daresay, despite getting the wicket of Botha with a rank long-hop, Pollard was quite poor in the end overs. Gayle's captaincy was rigid and questionable.

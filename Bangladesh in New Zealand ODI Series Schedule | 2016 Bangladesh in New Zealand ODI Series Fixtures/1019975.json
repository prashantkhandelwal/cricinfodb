One run-out turned things around as they lost their last nine wickets for 79 runs. New Zealand, without living up to their tall standards on the field, ran roughshod in the second half of this chase. In a game like this, it's really hard to find positive for the visitors, but their new gloveman impressed behind the stumps. But this game was about a man returning to the side after more than six years. Neil Broom's fine counter-attacking ton helped ride a proper wobble and set New Zealand up for their bowlers to finish this off.  They were on tenterhooks for a while before Bangladesh's cookie crumbled like we've known it to over the years. Hope you enjoyed the coverage. We'll be back on Friday for the conclusion of the series. Hopefully the year will end on a better note for the visitors, who will have to wait for their first ODI win on New Zealand shores.

Kayes thought he was out and was just about to exit when the umpires went upstairs to check who was actually out. Sabbir gets a rude shock of his life when he finds out he has to go.

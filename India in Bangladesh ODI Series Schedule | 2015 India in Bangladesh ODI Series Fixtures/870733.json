India need a lot of looking into the mirror. To take out into those celebrations on the streets or into what India see in the mirror will be exceeding the brief of this commentary.

You have to take risks in such a game, but if you keep losing two wickets in a row, it becomes difficult to do so. If you have 200 on the board, it is quite easy for the other teams to chase so I won't blame the bowlers for this game. We as batsmen got starts, but we didn't make it big. Where we lacked was the fact that we lost wickets. Most of them played two or three deliveries. They are bowling well as a unit. You can't really on just one or two bowlers. That is what they are doing well. Even when they didn't get a wicket,. they kept things tight. They got a bit of reverse but their lines and lengths were good. We will come and enjoy, maybe play a bit more freely. Won't think too much about the result. Will be the last match of the season, it has been a hectic season, and we are looking forward to it.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Very happy,\" says <b>Mustafizur Rahman</b>, the Man of the Match. \"My team-mates helped me a lot to help me do well.

MS Dhoni looked to weather the storm and open up in the end, but in the end there was Mustafizur, whose cutters cut through India once again.

When Bhaji came they decided not to take him on and lost a bit of momentum . Munaf has been bowling well for us in the last 10-20 games he has played. The part-timers also have bowled well. Yuvraj is our main batsman at no 4. He can dictate terms. Once he crosses 10-15 runs, you can see that he bats fantastically.

If you can't do well for 2-3 overs it's okay, but you should find a way to come back, and he really found that way, and found his rewards. We know we're playing back-to-back games, but no problem.

Hong Kong, though, can walk back with their head held high as they now shake hands with the Indians. It wasn't just a decent show with the bat from the Associate side, but also a great end to their innings with the ball as well.

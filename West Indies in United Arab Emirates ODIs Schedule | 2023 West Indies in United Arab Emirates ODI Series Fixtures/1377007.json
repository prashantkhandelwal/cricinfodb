He slammed 65 off 45 balls, stitching a 66-runs stand with Shamarh Brooks, who also played his part. At one point it seemed West Indies would secure the win much earlier, but the UAE spinners, Aayan Afzal Khan and Karthik Meiyappan got the West Indies batters on a leash. They bowled brilliantly in the middle phase not allowing any batter to get away. They picked two wickets apiece, so did debutant Jawadullah, but the 185-run target was always going to be tough to defend.

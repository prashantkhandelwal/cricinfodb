up outside off, and Kohli may have endangered Rohit's innings here. Stretches out and pushes into the point region, calls immediately for the single. Babaz runs in quickly from backward point, fires in a throw to Sarfraz, and Rohit, diving desperately, could be out in slightly unfortunate fashion here, his bat bouncing at impact and the part that is past the crease in the air when the bails go off. Is the bat in the air? The third umpire is checking. Given out, and from the angles shown, that seemed the right conclusion.

In the field we were still 6 today. Very strong performance, we've taken the confidence from the practice games. We need to tighten our fielding to compete hard against the best teams. Quite delighted with all batsmen chipping in with runs. Shikhar and Rohit - last time we won here, the opening partnership was crucial. Rohit took some time going, but he's coming back from an injury, and international cricket is different to IPL. I felt like a club batsman while playing alongside Yuvi, the way he was hitting the ball. And Hardik, 18 off five balls, was outstanding. We went with four seamers purely because we're playing Pakistan. They play spin really well, and most of them are right-handers. In pressure situations, to have mid-on, mid-off up and hit hard lengths, gives us an advantage. Against other sides, we might use two spinners, depending on their strengths.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Sarfraz Ahmed</b>: \"Everything was under control after 40 overs, but we lost the plot in the last eight.

Ah, here's a translation from Danyal: \"A year ago I wasn't in the side but I worked hard and believed in myself, and thankfully gave a good performance. Been learning since the start that if your body has energy you can perform well. I was very calm, no pressure on me, and thankfully I did well in all our games.

With the ball we could have had a few more wicket-taking opportunities. We tried to do out best, but even with the ball, they were aggressive, we didn't show any resistance apart from Hardik, whose knock was outstanding.

They came into the tournament ranked No. 8 in the world, took a hammering (from India) in their first match, then set about upending all form and predictions to claim the trophy. South Africa were stunned in the rain, in what was effectively a knockout; Sri Lanka were overcome despite a wobble, in what was effectively a knockout; England were dispatched with aplomb in what was definitely a knockout; and then India, the great rival, the pedigree 50-over side, one of the pre-tournament favourites - well, India were simply demolished.

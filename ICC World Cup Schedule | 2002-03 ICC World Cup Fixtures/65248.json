wickets going for a lot of big money strokes, but today it was intelligent cricket at its finest, Fleming pacing himself, picking off bad balls, occasionally improvising to break up line and length bowlers' rhythm, and slowly but steadily Pollock's game plan fell apart as to how to deal with it - every new bowler got collared early on, making it impossible for them to settle, forcing more bowling changes, and the constant right/left-hand batting combination at the rotating the strike frequently at the crease just added to the torment, and just as impressively, despite two lengthy interruptions for rain/technical problems, the batsmen settled back into their duties as if there was no stoppages at all"},{"type":"HTML","html":"Boucher will want to forget this game in a hurry, after dropping Fleming when on 53 with New Zealand 88/0 in the 14th over at that stage, and though McMillan nicked one to him in the next over, it was the wicket of Fleming which was the key today"},{"type":"HTML","html":"New Zealand's World Cup may now be transformed from disaster to potential power position in the space of one game (well, really two games, after the must-win affair against the West Indies prior too)"},{"type":"HTML","html":"Their likely forfeiture to Kenya means they're not in a position of safety just yet, but will keenly await the outcome of other matches yet

attempts, now they've won two on the trot, and for the first time they've beaten South Africa on their home turf for the first time in 9 attempts and just their second win over South Africa in their

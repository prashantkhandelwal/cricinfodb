When you are in that awkward position - out of your crease, the ball in line with the keeper, intentionally bowled, the least you should do is attempt to improvise - close the bat-pad gap, anything.

Sri Lanka strike. Not sure why that shot was required, he was doing it nicely. Vandersay tosses up that googly outside off. Zaman sees flight, runs down and doesn't bother about improvising once he sees the ball wide outside off. When you are in that awkward position - out of your crease, the ball in line with the keeper, intentionally bowled, the least you should do is attempt to improvise - close the bat-pad gap, anything. Zaman doesn't try, he lets his instinct take over, which is to bludgeon the ball, all in or back home.

Charles Williams says that one of the reasons for this, that bubbled away under the surface, was the sectarian divide in the team, the division between Catholics and Protestants that was potent in Australian society and politics throughout the first half of the 20th century."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Williams: Like all these things it's a mixture. Certainly there was that, and as Don said to me in a slightly bitter tone, it's the only time he got rather bitter during our conversation, 'Fingleton was the ringleader' and he said when they went to Melbourne they were met by priests in cassocks. You know, it was quite powerful stuff. That was part of it. Part of it of course was jealousy, straight jealousy, that Bradman was the hero, Bradman was the man that people wanted to see. If Bradman got out, all the grounds emptied even if Jack Fingleton was going in to bat. And that was irritating for people like O'Reilly and Fingleton, who were in their own right, cricketers of the highest standard."},{"type":"HTML","html":"The third problem was that Don himself was not the easiest character to get on with. He was, in his playing days, he was quite sharp, he was a pretty fierce Captain, he played to win and there wasn't much quarter given to the opponent or indeed sometimes his own side. He was also, up until the late '30s he was a teetotaller, didn't like all this noisy stuff, couldn't understand why people drank beer, didn't understand why people smoked, didn't see what good it did them."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Whereas the O'Reilly/Fingleton/Fleetwood-Smith those people, they all of them enjoyed a beer and enjoyed having a good time and there was a good deal of social tension of that nature. The classic story is when Don came out at Headingley in 1930 and all the boys rallied round and said, 'Well, you know, Braddles, you know, have a drink and celebrate', and he said, 'I'd rather go up to my hotel room and write a few letters', which he did, and listened to some music. Now that was an odd thing in a way, if I may put it like this without offence, for an Australian to do. An odd thing for anybody to do, but for an Australian particularly in a side like that, in a touring side, it was regarded as being pretty stand-offish, they didn't like it.

To bowl against Bradman with my way of bowling, I regarded it as the greatest experience that you could have out in the middle, because I acquitted myself - I think I just about broke even with him, too.

I did get him spilled a couple of times under tragic circumstances in the slips.

If a kid like that, 17, can do what he did to you there, there's not much hope.' But then again, the next Saturday, I rolled him head over heels first ball of the day, and I thought, 'God, this isn't a bad game at all; this'll do me, I'll stick at it.'

Instead, Merv took an ice-box full of bottles, so keen was he to give the men of the Windies the full blow-by-blow account of every run he'd made. So it was that half an hour later, Jones - who himself had contributed 216 - and Hughes and several other Australian players were in the Windies dressing-room, when a sudden hush fell upon the gathering."},{"type":"HTML","html":"They looked to the door and there was Sir Donald Bradman himself, being ushered into the room by several South Australian cricket officials.

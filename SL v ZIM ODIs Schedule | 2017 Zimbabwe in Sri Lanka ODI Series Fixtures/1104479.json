It was set up by the two spinners - Lakshan Sandakan and debutant Wanidu Hasaranga. They befuddled Zimbabwe's batsmen with their variations. The sweeps and reverse-sweeps, which reaped rich reward on Friday, let the visitors down today. Sandakan claimed his first four-wicket haul in ODI cricket, while Hasaranga became only the third player, after Taijul Islam and Kagiso Rabada, to claim a hat-trick on ODI debut. It all seemed like a blur. Just ask Cremer's men."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Zimbabwe also have to deal with the anxiety of Chatara leaving the field because of a possible knee injury.

Like I said, 150 was not good enough on that wicket."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Mathews, Sri Lanka captain: I wouldn't call it a clinical performance. We still dropped catches. The attitude and intensity was superb, though,. We just need to regroup, and it was great effort from the boys. Sandakan was absolutely brilliant, so was Wanidu. Credit should go to the selectors to pick him. I, honestly, haven't seem him much. Chasing a modest total, is not easy if you lose a couple of wickets early on. We can't thank Upul enough. He has moved up and down the order to accommodate others. He has been an unlucky player. Can't thank him enough."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Right, the series is level at 1-1.

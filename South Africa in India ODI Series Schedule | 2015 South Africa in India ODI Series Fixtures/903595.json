Overall not a very convincing win but good win, we can play a lot better. We're not playing to our capacity, not even 80%, in batting or bowling. As a complete batting unit we didn't perform well but we bounced back well. We knew we needed two good deliveries when Tahir and Rabada were batting. I won't say the game was in our hands but we had a good chance if we bowled in the right areas and needed only two good deliveries. It doesn't always go your way (talking about his batting), the top order has been scoring loads of runs in the last 2-2.5 years so lower order doesn't get a big chance to bat. Apart from Suresh there's nobody who loves to do that kind of a job when you go out and you just have to go for the big hits. The pace was very important on this wicket and the length too. Axar is not a big turner of the ball and he pitched it in the right areas.

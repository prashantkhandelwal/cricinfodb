Playing international cricket for 15+ years, you need to contribute more and more for your country and that's what I try to do each game. Sri Lanka are not an easy side to play against, they never give up and come hard. I really enjoyed (the pressure). Whenever there is pressure or expectation, I try to stay calm. I know the opponent might also think I'm a big player, that gives me an edge."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Dushmantha Chameera is the Man of the Match:</b> Very happy with the way I bowled. Good performance on a comeback. Was not under pressure coming into this series. Pleased with the role I'm playing for Sri Lanka and how I'm bowling."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Tamim Iqbal:</b> As I said at the end of the last game and beginning of this game, we have won the series but I thought we never played a complete game. We didn't play to our potential in this series. After winning the series, I can tell you there are a few areas to work on."},{"type":"HTML","html":"They had a very attacking mindset coming into this game and we helped them do that. We bowled too short. We didn't grab our opportunities, missed two catches at important times, and could have probably got 30 runs less to chase. (Dependency on seniors a worry?) It is, but I am someone who keeps believing in youngsters. I don't point fingers at them, because I know how hard they try. If they perform we will become a better team but it's always easy to criticise. I'm not someone who will criticise my own players."},{"type":"HTML","html":"There are lots of things I want to achieve individually and as a leader of this team."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>8.54 pm:</b> Presentations coming up."},{"type":"HTML","html":"While waiting for the presentations, here's something from off the field in Sri Lanka.

They will be pleased with this win, dead rubber or not. There's a big difference between losing 2-1 and 3-0, and Sri Lanka had a lot of good performances to take away from this game. Kusal Perera and Dushmantha Chameera led the way of course with bat and ball, but there were several useful nuggets of contribution from a host of others too.

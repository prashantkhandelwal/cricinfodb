South Africa bat deep and we would have liked to do well towards the end when we bowled. AB is probably the best player in the world. On this surface, we would have liked to make it a little more difficult for him, so we have to do our homework going into the next game.Every game in this series has been different, as have the grounds and the surfaces.

Gets a standing ovation for an innings that will go down as one of the finest in recent times. The South Africans, too, applaud him for the knock. What an innings this has been. A true masterclass. Right up there with the World Cup double century, if not better. Guptill took on the bowlers at will. When he wanted to launch them, he was able to, when he wanted to crunch a drive, he managed to get right to the pitch of the ball and play it with all of the elegance he could muster. And on the very rare occasion that he skewed something off the splice, it evaded South Africa's best fielders and their best efforts. But Guptill deserved to stay till the end and finish this off. And not to forget Ross Taylor's contribution. He did not play the prettiest of knocks, struggled for the most parts, but full marks to him for grinding it out and making sure wickets did not fall. It enabled Guptill to not worry about wickets in hand and express himself and how he expressed himself, with an innings for the ages."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Guptill finishes with the highest second-innings score by a New Zealand batsman and the fourth overall, behind Shane Watson (185 not out), MS Dhoni (183 not out) and Virat Kohli (183).

There's a spontaneous and loud appeal from behind the stumps and in front. The umpire, Suresh Shastri, thinks about it for a second and gives it in the bowler's favour. Yuvraj can't believe the call and stands rooted to his crease. This could be interesting. It looks like he's suggesting to the umpire that it came off shoulder.

One of those days, we didn't execute as we could have and you get hurt by a good team. [Loss to SA meant Edgbaston semi] You've got to beat everyone, so can't read too much into that.

[Woakes?] Extremely happy, he's a cool customer, goes about his business day in day out exceptionally he's one of the best in the first ten overs, him and Jofra were outstanding and the guys backed that up, which allowed us to stay on top.

The way we produced the goods showed how good we are and how we perform as a team. [First ball hit for four?] I just got my length wrong, got a little bit full and a world-class player like Warner is going to put it away. Got my length right and felt good after that. [Important to get early wickets?] Yeah, I don't think it was a bad wicket by any means and when you get wickets at the top they have to rebuild, and we kept the pressure on. We got off to a flyer chasing a relatively small total and that's probably the difference.

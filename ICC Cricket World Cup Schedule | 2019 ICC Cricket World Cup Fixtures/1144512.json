Sometimes change is good for the team. Today the way Haris batted, he is hungry to play in the game. He's the main factor, the turning point, the way he batted in the last 15 overs, it was like Jos Buttler. We have to work harder on fielding. Again we dropped so many catches today.

Not spin in particular. You need ot have a good start with the bat. We're losing a quick wicket almost all the time and then as we're building partnerships we're losing wickets. That's just the nature of the tournament. Struggling with a bit of confidence in our batting line-up. And thats cost 30-40 runs. We have to try. We've put in the practice. We're working hard. But confidence in sport is an amazing thing. When you're playing well, the ball just falls for you. But at the moment, we're down and when you play against a quality team like Pakistan, they put you under pressure. Imran Tahir has been amazing. He's been exceptional. He's played with a lot of heart and he's led our bowling attack but there hasn't been enough guys like Imran standing up. For me the biggest downside is that we're not doing justice to ourselves as team. We are playing against great teams. We've seen how crazy it is.

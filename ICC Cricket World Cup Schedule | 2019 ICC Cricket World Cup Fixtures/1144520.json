Quite bizarre on a flat pitch. It's crazy that things fall in place like that randomly. But we should have been clinical because the wicket was flat. We could have accelerated and got closer to their total. If batsmen are able to reverse sweep you for six on a 59 metre boundary there is not much you can do. And one side was 82 metres. Look they had to be a bit smart in the lines they bowled, but you can't do much with a short boundary. I thought they were going towards 360 at one stage and we did quite well to pull them back. We could have restricted them more but Ben played a good innings. We were quite happy at the break. We thought if we get a start we can get it but that didn't happen, we still had a partnership.

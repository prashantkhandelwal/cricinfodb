The fight that was shown in the middle and back end was good, to get us in a position where we were competitive. But that partnership with Babar and  Haris, they took it from us. [Shadab] yeah it was nice wasn't it? We tried to soak it up. Thought if we get 230-250, there was a chance. And there was, but they soaked up the pressure and played really nicely. When the threat is spin, especially when the wicket became a lot slower, we were trying to get anybody in there who would rotate the ball.

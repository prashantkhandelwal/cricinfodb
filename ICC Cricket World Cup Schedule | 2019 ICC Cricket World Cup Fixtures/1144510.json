You have to knock the ball around, and with three quality wrist-spinners, it was always difficult. (On Bumrah) It's simple - we want to use him smartly. When conditions allow us to.

Shami was really good today. He was making the ball move more than anybody. Vijay fielded with great intent. We knew these guys were hungry.

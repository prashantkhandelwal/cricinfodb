South Africa's good work started with the ball. Kagiso Rabada struck with the very first ball of the match, and Dwaine Pretorius found conditions very much to his liking. He settled into a steady line and length and reaped the reward with three cheap wickets. Chris Morris wasn't quite as economical, but he chipped in with three wickets of his own, and Sri Lanka's 203 all out was never going to be enough, barring another Malinga miracle. Alas, it was not forthcoming this time around. Quinton de Kock fell early, but Faf and Amla were rock solid in taking South Africa home.

We haven't had guys batting through, and big partnerships, but that was the case today. One big partnership, and suddenly everything seems so much easier.

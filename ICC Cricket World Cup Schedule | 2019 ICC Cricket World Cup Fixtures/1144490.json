Was absolutely outstanding to get Amla out like that in ODIs, I haven't seen it (caught in the slips). To get Quinny as well was outstanding. We're confident as a group, with the bat we had to be careful. That's why I said Rohit's innings was special.

Morris too was superb, bowled well and scored some crucial runs with the bat. Ours is a change room that is hurting, trying to make sure we keep fighting but we're making mistakes all the time.

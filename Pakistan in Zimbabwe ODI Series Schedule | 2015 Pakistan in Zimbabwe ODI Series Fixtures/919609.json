The match has been called off and Zimbabwe have levelled the series</b> in controversial circumstances. The light has not got any better. Pakistan can be extremely proud of their performance, and Malik even more so. It was a real masterclass in batting under pressure with more than the bowling to worry about. He paced it unbelievably well and it is a shame that we didn't get to see a 100-over match. But, such is cricket and life. Zimbabwe can be extremely happy with the win but they did stumble towards the end under pressure. Initially though, things were entirely different. Zimbabwe bowled tight lines and held onto their catches and some of Pakistan's batsmen threw their wickets away. Nonetheless, nothing should be taken away from the quality of the game and grit from the batsmen from both sides."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Azhar Ali: 'It was a lovely game, Malik and Yamin made us comeback in the game when it looked like a one-sided game.

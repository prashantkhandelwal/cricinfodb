As it turned out, even if South Africa had stopped their innings at 7-down, they would have won extremely comfortably. Dale Steyn owned most of this match - a 60 and then two early wickets. Ngidi got a few to bounce up nastily off the pitch and immediately Zimbabwe's batsmen looked anxious. That was where the crack was made, and Tahir turned it into a full blown gash.

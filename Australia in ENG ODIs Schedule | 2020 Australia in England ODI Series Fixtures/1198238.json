With Roy, Bairstow, they really leave nothing in the sheds. We were lucky to get a couple early. There are a few things to work on but everything's going really well. Sometimes we rest at the end of the Test series, so it's good to play when we're fresh. Hopefully I'll play a few in the months to come.

There were a couple of little cracks that Jofra and Chris Woakes exploited. It was a new-ball wicket - it was toughest to bat then. [Marsh/Maxwell] It was a great partnership. They paced it really well. They played two really smart, mature innings and I'm really happy for them two to get some runs. On that wicket, I thought we were a big chance if we bowled well early. I thought that was a really good frontline attack for that wicket, but we know how destructive England can be when they get it right.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Eoin Morgan:</strong> \"The game probably slipped away from us in the first 10-12 overs with the bat.

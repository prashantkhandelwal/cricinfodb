That should have been Kulasekara's length from the start. Full and straight, gets juuust enough nip back in. Pitches on off, Moor brings his bat down in line but the ball jags back in just enough to beat the inside edge. Moor's feet were nowhere, neither forward not back. Ended up rooted in the crease and struck Moor in front of middle and leg. Easy decision for umpire Shamsuddin.

The pacers went into the pitch, used the cutters, cross seamers well. Zampa had his work cut out and he stood up big time. The openers put up 81. Ellis took a great reaction catch to send back QDK, Zampa then got into the game. He pinned Bavuma lbw, had Markram with a great boundary catch. Hardie got his first ODI wicket - van der Dussen - with a cross seamer. Klaasen got going, Miller offered him support. But Zampa knocked Klaasen over with the googly.

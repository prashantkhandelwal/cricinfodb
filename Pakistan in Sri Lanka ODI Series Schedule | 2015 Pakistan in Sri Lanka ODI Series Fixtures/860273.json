Sri Lanka were set a target bigger than any that has been chased successfully in Sri Lanka, and they needed Perera and Dilshan to get off to a flying start. Anwar Ali, however, dismissed then in his first spell with slower offcutters, whereupon the spinners established a choke hold on Sri Lanka, which Pakistan never released.

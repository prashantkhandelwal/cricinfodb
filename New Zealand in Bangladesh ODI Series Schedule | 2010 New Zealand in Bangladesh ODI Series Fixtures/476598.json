On the other hand the New Zealanders are really behind the eight-ball now, needing to win the last two games just to avoid a series defeat. Expect changes to the middle order for the next game, particularly in light of Stewart's head knock. You would have been forgiven today if you had thought the New Zealanders were actually Bangladesh given the way they played today.

And it is a victory that has been well-earned. They have thoroughly outplayed Afghanistan in every regard - with the bat, with the ball and on the field. In keeping with the landmark win, another record was created with Tamim Iqbal registering his seventh ODI century - the highest for any Bangladesh player. Not to forget the contributions of Sabbir Rahman who built a solid platform with Tamim, and Mahmudullah who gave them the late surge. Afghanistan had to endure many embarrassing moments on the field, their day filled with several blunders on the field. But while their bowlers showed some fight, the batsmen were nowhere in the contest. But for a brief second-wicket stand between Nawroz Mangal and Rahmat Shah, there was no semblance of a fight. And Bangladesh were also the better side by a distance as far as fielding is concerned. They nailed a couple of direct hits that sped up the Afghanistan collapse. All in all, a clinical performance to earn a historic

It was a combination of thin batting (Afridi bats at No. 6), low confidence, and defensive mindset that took the asking rate to over 7 for the last 20, and close to nine for the last 15. Wickets fell under pressure, but Perera's effort should not be forgotten. He kept Pakistan under check with regular wickets, six of them. And that catch to dismiss Hafeez was an absolute blinder. How about this? Sri Lanka conceded only two extras, and that too leg-byes. A toss-up between Dilshan and Perera for the Man of the Match.

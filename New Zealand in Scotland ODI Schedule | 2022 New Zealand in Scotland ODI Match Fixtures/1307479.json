Just get your head down and go for it.  I guess coming into this sort of Northern Taurus, it's a lot of T20. So the winter I did spend a lot of time just working on, trying to hit down the ground and  with some force. So just happy that you know the works paying off. I think we possess some power load down. So for us it was just about taking it deep. And then you know, trying to get one or two big overs to really kill the game. So I think we did that pretty well. 300 on the board, run a ball, quick outfield , some smaller sides and, you know, we really backed ourselves to just keep forgetting so they will play."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Richie Berrington</strong>: There was a lot of good stuff in there today, I thought and of course the things I think we probably missed an opportunity to get to that 350 mark, maybe just by losing a couple of wickets after that first power play. We're off to a really good start. But I thought Matthew Cross and Michael Leask  played fantastically well. Especially striking from Leask all the way through the back end of the earnings. I think probably on the surface you needed to be maybe 340-350 to really have a good chance of winning that game. But I still think 300 on the board give yourself give yourself a chance but just unfortunately didn't manage to create enough of those chances. Especially with a single day especially when a couple of guys get sick. And through the middle when you've only got the four bowlers. It's a fine balance of trying to obviously squeeze but also like to try and take wickets, so unfortunately we didn't manage to get those wickets to the middle but there was a lot of good stuff in there. Off spinner bowled really well and made it  challenging. I think for us, it's just trying to adapt to those as quick as we can.  But today we're short how much depth we have got, so that was that was really pleasing to see. We've got a really important series coming up in just over a week's time, cricket League. So again, certainly a lot of learnings we can take from the experiences we've had this week against the very good sides, and just a few things that we can maybe look to build on going forward."},{"type":"HTML","html":":"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Mitchell Santner</strong>: Clinical chase.

It's obviously a tough ground to defend, but I just think we kind of went away from what was working.  On the flip side, you know, 300 was pretty par on that and on that ground. (On Chapman) - we know he's a quality player and he's had, I guess, limits of opportunity, but he's made the most of the last two games for sure. Yeah, I think it was the way we went about and the chase was outstanding. We're kinda it appeared there.

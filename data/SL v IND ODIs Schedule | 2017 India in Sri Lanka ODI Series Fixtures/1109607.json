Here it was the case of the wicket being a little challenging. A couple of those wickets, you wouldn't get those wickets 8 out of 10 times. Rohit was outstanding, MS was great as well. These things happen, the [young] guys will learn in the middle order, we have to be patient with them. Bumrah's got 11 wickets in three games, he's bowled really well, he's among our top short-format bowlers at the moment. He hits the right areas, bowls at pace, and in the death overs he's like a fish in water. We have a squad of 15, we'll look to give some guys a go, see how their game stands up in different situations.

Stand-in captain Keshav Maharaj asks Tabraiz Shamsi to lead the winning team off the field. But as important as Shamsi's five was Janneman Malan's 121. That set the base for South Africa to post an imposing total over here on a deck that had a fair amount of turn all day.<BR><BR>It was a stop-start day with rain delaying toss, and then another break midway through the second innings too. Also worth mentioning is Reeza Hendricks' 54-ball 51 and Heinrich Klaasen's 27-ball 43. That gave South Africa the momentum at the break. After that came Kagiso Rabada's red-hot new-ball spell that picked off two early wickets. Charith Asalanka entertained again by hitting 77 in 69 balls but he did not get much support from the other batters. With the required run-rate rising and Sri Lanka needing to attack, Shamsi then feasted on the middle and lower-middle order. It sets the series up for a mouth-watering finale on Tuesday.

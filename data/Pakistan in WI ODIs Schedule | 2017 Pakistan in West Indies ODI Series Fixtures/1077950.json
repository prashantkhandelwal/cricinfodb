It's been the Babar and Hasan show. A career-best century for Babar Azam followed by a career-best 5 for 38 for Hasan Ali.

That's where West Indies let the game slip and then they go no sort of platform with the bat, falling to 75 for 6 before the lower order showed some fight. So that all means we have a series decider, back at this ground, on Tuesday. It should be a terrific end to the short series.

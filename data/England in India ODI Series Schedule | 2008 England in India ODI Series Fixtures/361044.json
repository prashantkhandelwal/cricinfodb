We improved from the last game. Let's hope we improve more. We need to carry on our good start with the ball. One of the top five should have gone on to a big score. I don't think we missed a specialist spinner. Samit bowled ok. I bowled five overs of rubbish.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Dhoni:\" Great performance by Yuvi and Gambhir. You've got to change the target every 5 to 10 overs. As the partnership between them grew we kept raising our target. We are enjoying each other's success.  Yusuf was up to the mark, this will help boost his confidence. We'll take it one game at a time.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Yuvraj is the Man of the Match. He gets a bike. Here's what he said: \"Been training hard over the last few months and it's paying off. At 29 for 3 I wanted to assess the wicket, spoke to Gambhir a lot about the target. There were some shots you couldn't play on this wicket.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"That's it from us. Thanks for your company. Join us for the third ODI in Kanpur (day game) on November 20.

following order of priority:\n\nThe team with the most number of wins in the group matches will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIf there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the group matches, then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the group matches will be placed in the higher position\n\nIf still equal, the team which was the winner of the head to head match played between them will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIf there are teams which are still equal, then the team with the higher number of wickets taken per balls bowled in the group matches in which results were achieved will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIn the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated by the above this will be done by drawing lots.\n\nIf all matches within a Group are abandoned, the top 4 seeded teams in each group will progress to the Super Eight stage.\n\n<b>Super Eight Stage</b>\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points at the end of the Super Eight stage, the order of finishing will be decided in the following order of priority:\n\nThe most wins in all of the matches throughout the competition against the other Super Eight stage qualifiers will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIf there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the Super Eight stage then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in all matches played against the other Super Eight qualifiers (in both the Group stage and Super Eight stage) will be placed in the higher position (refer to 21.9.6 below for the calculation of net run rate).\n\nIf still equal, the team which was the winner of the head to head match played between them will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIf there are teams which are still equal, then the team with the higher number of wickets taken per balls bowled in the Super Eight stage in which results were achieved will be placed in the higher position.\n\nIn the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated by the above this will be done by drawing lots.\n\n\n<b>Net Run Rate</b>\n\nA team‟s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition. \n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2‟s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of oversfaced by Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Super

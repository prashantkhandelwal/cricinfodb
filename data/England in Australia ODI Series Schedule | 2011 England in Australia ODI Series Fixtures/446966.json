It was a team effort from them with both bat and ball today, Michael Clarke finding some semblance of form with his half-century. It looked like England would push them close and perhaps even keep the series alive during Pietersen and Bell's 73-run stand, but after they were dismissed England collapsed in a heap before the tailenders slogged their way to a record-breaking, but ultimately futile, partnership. England certainly haven't been at their best in this series - Eoin Morgan's failure to fire has surely had something to do with that. He had a long break with very little cricket at all during the Tests, does that have something to do with it? England have two more games to get things right before they head to the subcontinent.

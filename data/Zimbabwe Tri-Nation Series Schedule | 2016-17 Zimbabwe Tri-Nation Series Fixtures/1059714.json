through quicker, on a length, outside off. There is a lot of width on offer and Mendis tries to use the pace and run it down to third man by opening he face of his bat. He had to reach out for it and gets an outside edge that is snaffled by the wicketkeeper. Mendis is livid with himself and another Sri Lanka batsman misses out on a century.

He keeps an eye on both somehow. Keeps running back, and even as square leg is coming close to him, he keeps his eye on the ball and completes a stunning catch with both hands in front of him, diving to the ground as ball makes contact with his hands.

He keeps an eye on both somehow. Keeps running back, and even as square leg is coming close to him, he keeps his eye on the ball and completes a stunning catch with both hands in front of him, diving to the ground as ball makes contact with his hands.

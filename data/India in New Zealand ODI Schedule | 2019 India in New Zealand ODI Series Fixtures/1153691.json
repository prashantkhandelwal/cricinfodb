And replays show he's right. Exceptional bowling. This is the result of the other trick in his bag - change of pace. And it's almost like he's sensed his moment. Taylor's been itching to smash Chahal. But the legspinner's been too good with his drift and dip. Now the batsman has to make a choice. Take a risk. He comes dancing out of his crease. Chahal is ready for it. Pulls his length back. Draws his pace down. Doesn't let Taylor anywhere near the ball and the shot - a tame push down the pitch - results in a low catch, which he takes diving forward.

Did England mis-read the conditions in deciding to bat first? They surely weren't helped by the disastrous start to their innings, but on a pretty benign surface 237 was well under par. Vinay Kumar's career-best 4 for 30 did most of the damage, but India looked like a unit and were generally good in the field too. And then came the chase. The openers didn't last long but Gambhir and Kohli looked totally at ease, despite the clear aggression from the England bowlers and fielders. They put on an unbroken 209 - a new Indian record for the third wicket - to put their team 2-0 up.

We never let them get a partnership together. Gautam played brilliantly, Virat is a strokeplayer. Gautam's innings at No. 3 was crucial, the ball was still moving a bit when he got in. The pitch was a bit too placid, I'd prefer a bit more turn. I think a turning wicket is a sporting track in India. But this was a good ODI wicket.

On this kind of wicket if you play good cricket shots you can get boundaries. I'm definitely hungry for more, you never know when you can hit a bad patch.

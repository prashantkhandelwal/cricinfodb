But it wasn't easy for newcomers. One side boundary was short, and that was my plan - to target it. I was just waiting for the message, looking for partnership, but that wasn't in our hands. When the run-rate was going over 11, I was just hitting. I was trying, but you know, it's a funny game. Good thing for us was we got close. I can't say if it's my best innings.

There's an opportunity for us as a fielding team to dissect what happened in that period and what areas we can improve on. I was thinking about taking wickets when they were seven down, that's why we got Shamsi in, but got to give him credit when it's due. In terms of our batting, I felt batting was tough up front when I came in. In the morning, there is something for the bowlers. When I came in with Quinny, it was about building a partnership and inject some momentum. Allowed one of our first three batsmen play deep allowed Rassie and David to play their cameos. We'll be trying to clear our minds and rest our bodies before the final game. Two games with one day's rest isn't easy. Make sure when we come back for the next ODI, we want to cover our bases.

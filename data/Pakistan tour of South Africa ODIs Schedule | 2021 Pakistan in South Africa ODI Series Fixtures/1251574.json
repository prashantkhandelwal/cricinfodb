I have to give credit to Hassan Ali here, the way he came in and played. He made the main difference. It was quite surprising to face spin at the death, but after seeing the pitch yesterday, we did get an idea that we could face a fair bit of spin here. So we weren't unprepared.

So our plan was simple, that we will just survive the first 10 overs. (Scoring two 100s) means a lot. I was suffering from two years, I didn't score. So it really means a lot to me.

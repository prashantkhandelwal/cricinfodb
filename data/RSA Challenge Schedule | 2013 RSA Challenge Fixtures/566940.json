Morgan was matched by Bopara, who looked good from the off and grew into a sparkling innings: the two old stagers, relatively speaking, saving England's greenhorns after the green shirts had turned the top order into grass. Their unbroken stand of 226 set a new fifth-wicket record in ODIs. Credit will rightly shower down on Ireland, though, for having pushed England so hard for 80% of the game; for having staged a cracking match in front of an appreciative crowd; and, not least, for having produced two of the three century-makers. They also had a hand in England's bowling success, with Boyd Rankin taking four-for - though Lambeth's Tim Murtagh returned the favour during the England

That's where this game crossed untenable and into impossible. India's start - that outstandingly rapid partnership between Rohit and Gill - remains the biggest reason SL have lost this game, but they kept fighting. And Dasun Shanaka epitomised that fight, bringing up his second ODI century, and leading their ninth wicket partnership to an unbroken 100. India have taken the series lead and they're usually hard to catch when they play at home."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Shanaka</b>: The start from India's batters and our bowlers didn't use the new ball well. Their bowlers used the swing very well. I think there was a plan, but the bowlers didn't execute it. We need to stick to the stump line and use the slower balls. I think I'm doing the basics well. I think in ODIs, I'm not doing that well and T20Is I might have to go up the order."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Rohit</b>: We started off really well and to get that total was a great effort from all the batters. The platform was set to come out and play freely. I thought we could've bowled slightly better, but don't want to be too critical of it although the dew was not so much. We bowled well as a unit and if you want to win games like this, everyone has to come to the party. There are some areas we need to look at as a group and again it's a team sport. No, I mean I had no idea Shami did that. Again, he's batting on 98 and the way he batted was brilliant. Cannot get him out like that and wanted to get him out the way we wanted to get him out. Hats off to him."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Kohli, Player of the Match</b>: I don't think there was anything different. My preparation and intent always stay the same and I just kept backing my intent. As I said during the mid-innings break, it was very close to the template I play with. I also understood we needed an extra 25-30 runs. The only thing I learnt was desperation doesn't get you anywhere. You have to play for the right reasons and almost play every game like your last and just be happy about it. The game is going to move on and I'm happy with my space."},{"type":"HTML","html":"That is all we have for you from this game. Thanks for your company and comments.

His 146-run second wicket stand with Rahmat Shah broke the chase open, and by the time he fell at the end of the 30th over, the required rate was at a very manageable five an over. Sri Lanka's bowlers toiled, but rarely managed to put pressure on the Afghan batters. In the field too Afghanistan showed discipline, and only really looked under the pump when Charith Asalanka (91) and Dhananjaya de Silva (51) were going strong. 268 was a challenging total, but Sri Lanka will know they missed an opportunity to put up an imposing one, losing wickets at crucial junctures.

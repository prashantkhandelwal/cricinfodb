To play with positive intent is the main goal. The wicket today was better - the ball was not swinging and it was coming onto the bat. We knew with the partnerships we had, we were going to score big today. Toss is important as well but at the end of the day, the toss does not define whether we would win or lose. It is the skills that make it happen. (On batting in the death overs) We did not play on these type of pitches - here, it is different, so, credit must go to the ground staff as well. Our top four fired today and this is the way we should bat. Wanindu and myself ended well. (On Chameera) He is bowling with that intent and he has the skills to play white-ball cricket, and that is what is most important. At any time, we should have a player like that in our team.

(On the toss) I think the pitch was not very difficult in the second innings also. 30 extra runs that Sri Lanka made against us meant that the pressure was on us and that was the main point.

They set the tone with the ball in the powerplay, with Chameera accounting for Gurbaz early. Afghanistan could never really get going and once the required run-rate zinged up to more than eight runs per over, they were always playing catch-up.

they won't be entirely satisfied with their all- round performance today they will no doubt believe they gave Bangladesh 30-50 runs more than they should've in the end, lengthening their chase considerably, which was done pretty safely throughout, but there were stuttery periods where runs didn't exactly flow off the bat all five batsmen used got starts and made contributions, McMillan leading the way, 'born again' as an opening batsman to fill a role in South Africa, smacking 75 off 83 balls in typical belligerent fashion, being rather inventive at times, though ultimately it also caused his downfall in less-than-glamorous style Fleming looked very classy again, following on from his epic ton against South Africa, but attempted an inexplicable stroke, and though replays show it is hard to tell whether he was caught directly off the knee or there was a little underedge first, he paid the price and had to depart, Adams came in and played a handy little cameo before Styris and Cairns came together to do the final damage not much to talk about in terms of the Bangladesh bowling, except for Khaled Mahmud, who bowled his 10 overs straight, being very hard to get away, mixing up his pace and taking all three wickets to fall, an impressive performance given his side and fellow bowlers were on a hiding to nothing once New Zealand made a safe start and an upset wasn't really on the cards any more time for the presentations, and it should be a toss-up for Man of the Match between Shane Bond and Craig McMillan today and for his punishing knock of 75 from 83 deliveries,

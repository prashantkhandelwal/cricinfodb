bowlers, you will end up shooting yourself in the  foot eventually, Bichel proved a master foil, sometimes even outdoing the master himself, top scoring in the end New Zealand came out with a strange approach, mixing very   aggressive intent with laconic periods, and whilst that approach        may have worked against lesser bowling attacks, it was unlikely to succeed today the use of Vettori at the top of the order was a strange change  from what had worked quite successfully with McMillan in his  place, even though he still hasn't really shown any sort of  sparkling form this tournament except against Bangladesh this exposed Astle very early in the piece, exactly what New   Zealand had been trying to avoid in recent times by placing him at  No 3, and the predictable occurred, two down for not many this fuelled Australia's ever-growing belief that they could win  this match, and after a few handy but unsubstantial partnerships,  on came Australia's own wrecking ball to emulate Bond's efforts from earlier today it was a masterly move by Ponting, particularly given how Lee had been taken to in his opening spell, he snared the pivotal wicket of Fleming with a rather poor delivery, but that's what happens when you've got your tail up, you make your own luck from there it was just a procession, with the quick man taking a leaf out of Shoaib Akhtar's book by bowling yorkers angling in from around the wicket at the Kiwi left-handers, knocking over  Oram's off pole first ball, and showed he could york a couple of right-handers to boot, finishing with 5-42 from 9.1

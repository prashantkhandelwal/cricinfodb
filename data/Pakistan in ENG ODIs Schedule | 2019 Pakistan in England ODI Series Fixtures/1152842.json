I was in prime position today to see the whole innings and his freakish knocks seems to be getting closer and closer together, which a great sign for us going forwards.

We've seen a grand total of 734 runs scored at the Ageas Bowl, but the scales in the end tipped England's way, as Pakistan could not find an imitation Jos Buttler-style stimulant at the death. Buttler was pretty much the difference, hitting as many sixes as Pakistan did combined, as England splurged 74 off their last five overs to take this game ultimately out of reach. Still, not many gave Pakistan an icicle's chance in Hell at halfway, so the spirited way in which they took this to the last few balls is a positive for their chances over the coming weeks. Fakhar Zaman was like a stately wrecking ball, picking off boundaries in between much scampering, Asif Ali showed the man in green how to light the blue touchpaper, and Sarfaraz kept on battling to the end. But while no one could die down Buttler at the death, David Willey, Liam Plunkett and Chris Woakes (just about) held their nerve with the ball for

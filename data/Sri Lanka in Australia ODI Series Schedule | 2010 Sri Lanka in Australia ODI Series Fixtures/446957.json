They last won a game in July. They had the Sri Lankan batsmen playing without using their brains, and had 132 to defend with those last two wickets remaining. Then Sri Lanka took the Powerplay and set the cat among the pigeons. They batted incredibly since then, a mix of slogs, and classical hitting. Mathews's aerial drives, after charging down to fast bowlers, were ones for the albums. Don't forget the contribution from the other half of the Josephian Mafia: Thisara Perera bowled splendidly to take five wickets. He did what the Aussie bowlers didn't do: move the old ball off the straight. And finally, what a week it has been for the good-old 50-over cricket. There is life in the old dog yet.

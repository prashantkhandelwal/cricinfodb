What a performance from Sri Lanka, in both games. The teams are shaking hands now, Sri Lanka have won by 29 runs by the Duckworth-Lewis system. There are plenty of Sri Lankan fans in the SCG, just as there were in Melbourne. Upul Tharanga is the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 86."},{"type":"HTML","html":"What a day - it's 11.20pm local time - I can't remember a later finish to an ODI in Australia. The Sri Lankans have thoroughly deserved this series win. Today they batted well, but it was really the bowlers that won them the match. Murali was on song in his last match at the SCG, and Malinga was very difficult to get away when his slower ball was working. Not to mention the wickets delivered by Perera and Kulasekara. Australia will be hoping for a consolation win in the final match at the Gabba on Sunday, where they'll also no doubt make a few team changes."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Thanks for joining us, and be sure to return for Sunday's final ODI.

He could have broken Mick Lewis' record for most expensive figures had he had the opportunity to bowl his final over.

Too many simple chances were put down by a side that has to take every opportunity presented in order to compete with otherwise superior opponents."},{"type":"HTML","html":"The Test match saw the Kiwi Taylor triumph over the visiting Taylor. The ODI series has seen Brendon dominate his opposite number Brendan.

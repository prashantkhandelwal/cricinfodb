Tonight is the night to celebrate this win. Bangladesh were better prepared, more intense, and more resilient than the Champions Trophy champions, World Cup semi-finalists and the No. 2 side in the world. Right from the ball one, when India's quicks just ambled in and showed a lack of intensity, Bangladesh's aggressive batsmen took over, and despite a stumble in the middle they kept on coming hard at India. They then saw India's openers resist them and also turn the heat on, they dropped two catches, were embarrassed a little when they tried to run our a batsman who was walking presuming he had been dismissed already, but they didn't give up. Their fast bowlers kept coming at India. Apart from Mustafizur's cutters, there was another factor: Taskin's remarkable accuracy. He bowled like New Zealand did against India last year at home. Just be intense, bowl as fast as possible, an in-between length and away from them: just inside the tram lines. This is a really really precise art. He pulled it off. Frustrated Kohli to play a nothing shot. Rohit and Rahane followed. This was excellent ODI bowling. Now leaving Bangladesh to celebrate and India to lick their wounds, this is Sidharth Monga saying goodbye"},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Yes it was disappointing,\" says <b>MS Dhoni</b>. \"But Bangladesh played some really good cricket as a team. Right from the first ball they took our bowlers on. The rain break helped us. It looked like they would score more than 330 but we restricted them to 300, but the batting didn't turn up the way we wanted it to. The spinners bowled well, Raina's contribution was important, but disappointed with the way the fast bowlers bowled. The Bangladesh batsmen played the fast bowlers well. What I am was particularly impressed with how subtly they changed their pace. They didn;t bowl 140 and then 110, but took it down marginally. They did well in the World Cup because of their fast bowlers so we were not surprised they relied on fast bowlers tonight. And they have Shaklib who can bowl any time they need him. We will go to the drawing board. Not just batters. Overall we need to sketch a new plan to see what the best way to beat Bangladesh is.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Definitely delighted,\" says <b>Mashrafe Mortaza</b>. \"Can't ask for more. Mustafizur was not a surprise for us. We know he can destroy any batsman. It was a brilliant start from Tamim and Samya. We lost a bit of momentum with the rain, but Rahman and Shakib did it for us. Yes it was a bit of a risk to play four quicks, but I trusted my boys. Maybe we were 15-20 short, but 300 is a big ask for anybody.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"I wanted to perform well on debut,\" says <b>Mustafizur Rahman</b>, the Man of the Match. \"I know only a few have taken five on debut, but all I wanted was to do well against India.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Me and Soumya just wanted to enjoy our batting,\" says Tamim. \"Unfortunately he got out otherwise we would have got much more. To be honest I was also surprised with four fast bowlers in Bangladesh, but they bowled superbly. We knew if we get one, more will come. Mustafiz bowled exceptionally well. If you don't express yourself in the middle, it is a waste of talent. That is what our coach says. If we get out playing our shots, it's okay.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"The real expression, though, came from Mustafizur and the other three quicks. Taskin, who himself took a five-for on debut (against the same team), began the turnaround by taking Dhawan and Kohli out, but then Mustafizur ran through India with his cutter, which is what the name suggests: more a cutter than a slower ball. The drop in pace is not as big as the deviation off the straight is. He changes it late. It is not a finger-cutter. It is more wrist thing with his forearm lending the ball the fizz. A bit like Murali he is bowling that finger break with wrist and forearm providing the impetus, thus delaying the change in action and adding deception. India were blindsided by Bangladesh's intensity and skill. This was a great performance from Bangladesh but not without unsavoury incidents. There were collisions with India seemingly suggesting the young Mustafizur deliberately came in their way. Dhoni's collision  caused the youngster to be leave the field for a bit. There was extra sting in Bangladesh after that, which was most evident when they got Dhoni out. The umpires had to ask Bangladesh to keep it down too. But now nobody will ask them to keep it down: they can party all night"},{"type":"HTML","html":"This is Bangladesh's joint-second-largest win against a Test team not Zimbabwe. Their ninth straight win at home. But you'd venture this is the prized catch. The big fish. Emotion in the stands, dances among the crowds and the players.

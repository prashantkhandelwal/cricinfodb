England will not throw in the towel at any stage, Sam played well, but we kept taking wickets to put enough pressure on them. The mindset shifted in the last couple of overs. Hardik and Nattu were brilliant to finish it off. [It's] most disappointing for the guy to drop the catch. Everyone wants to do the best for the team on the field, but catches do get put down. But as individuals there's no lack of intent and we eventually ended up crossing the line. I mean I'm surprised that Thakur wasn't the Man of the Match. Four wickets and scoring 30 runs and Bhuvi was a big contender for Man of the Series. These guys were the difference in middle overs and powerplay. Prasidh and Krunal were impressive, but the most pleasing thing is the depth of our batting. Very exciting times ahead for us. It has been an amazing season for us and we wanted to finish on a high. This tour has been sweet, winning every series. Enjoy the IPL and back again with this group of guys. It is [a bit of a respite] for the support staff.

But, today, it wasn't meant to be. To come back from Tests and do this will give me a lot of confidence. To be honest, going outside off is a better way to counteract that [inswing]. Now, I'll be facing him at the [SRH] nets, don't have to worry about that. It was special from him [Curran] to take the game deep and his hitting was special. Obviously, credit to Nattu for nailing his yorkers. Obviously, everyone knows what Nattu does at the death. Fair play to him."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Sam Curran, Man of the Match</b>: We didn't win the game, but happy with the way I played. I haven't done something like that for a while especially for England. Disappointed with the finish. I had a few messages from the dug-out as well: try to bat deep and try to take most of the strike. Fair play to Natarajan - he had six deliveries there and showed why he's a good bowler. I knew that one side is shorter and Bhuvi is an outstanding bowler. As I said, a massive learning curve for me, but disappointed at the end. Again, it's a learning series with the ball and feel like it has given me a lot of confidence for the IPL and next IPL. Going straight there [CSK] for the IPL."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Jos Buttler, England (stand-in) captain</b>: Yeah, fantastic game. Both times made mistakes and played some brilliant cricket. Unbelievable innings from Sam Curran...congratulations to India. We're disappointed, we came here and we wanted to win, but there have been great learnings throughout the process. The white-ball leg has been fantastic and close and today was no different. I think playing cricket in India is always a learning (experience) - the guys who made their debuts in this series. Guys will go away as better cricketers. It was a fantastic wicket and we didn't bowl as well at the top but we dragged it back fantastically in the end. We pegged Hardik and Pant back to that total. A few guys [are] missing out, but the talent pool in white-ball cricket is growing and we'll continue to strive to do that. It was an amazing effort from Curran to take a lot of ownership and take most of the strike. I know Sam will be disappointed but he showed a lot of character and we are all proud of him."},{"type":"HTML","html":"It's also that time of the day or rather night.

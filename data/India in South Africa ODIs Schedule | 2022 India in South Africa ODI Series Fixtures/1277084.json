The complacency got to us when we thought we had the game in the bag but we managed to bring things back. A little bit crazy. Very satisfying, it's mission accomplished for us as a team. Not many people gave us much of a chance. I hope we've shown with our performances we've got some more supporters, even with you guys in the commentary box. Quinton's been great, he's shows what a valuable asset he is. Rassie has also been tremendous. The batters as a whole were quite good. The bowling as well, not individually today but yes as a group. This was a big challenge and obstacle in our journey, winning the two series will do good for our confidence. The Test series was the hardest series I was a part of, the Indian bowlers kept asking the hard questions, even the fielding intensity was high. In one-dayers too it wasn't easy, very challenging. Even in these conditions, which were more subcontinent-like, it's another feather in our cap. Very pleasing to contribute to the team, even better when the team wins.

Quite an exciting game, disappointing that we ended up on the losing side. it's quite obvious where we've gone wrong and it's for everyone to see, our shot selection has been really poor as batsmen. Even as bowlers we weren't hitting the good areas consistently. We didn't pressure the opposition for long periods so we ended up losing the series. We need to recognise now how we can get better. what has always stood out for us is the energy and the passion, and the skill and understanding of the game. These kind of mistakes will keep happening, but it's. important we learn and don't keep repeating the mistakes. In the ODIs we repeated some of the mistakes. We need to look at ourselves in the mirror and have some hard conversations. We've had a great time in South Africa, we were looked after really well, thanks to CSA. We had an exciting series, we showed a lot of fight, in patches.

And why not? What a tour this has been. They lost the first Test in Centurion, and since then they've gone on to win everything. Bavuma has a big smile on his face, Deepak Chahar is equally dejected near the rope, still padded up. The Indian players start coming out of the dressing room for handshakes all around as South Africa soak up this victory in the setting sun. That India came close today, thanks to Chahar, is another story but they will have a lot of reflection to do after this 3-0 loss. Their spinners weren't effective, their middle order didn't rise to the occasion, and they barely clinched any of the decisive moments in the three games. The last time India were whitewashed was two years ago, in New Zealand, and here they are with a different captain, vice-captain, coach, different looking squad, and the result is the same."},{"type":"HTML","html":"South Africa, meanwhile, have plenty to be proud of.

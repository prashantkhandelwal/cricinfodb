Andile went around the wicket like the last game, and got the left-hander overbalancing while slipping a normal pace delivery down leg.

Venkatesh has dragged his foot back behind the crease - but the question is, was it in the air when the bails were whipped off? And there appears to be a tiny gap, so the third umpire rules the foot was in the air, and Andile has got another wicket in the fashion he did in the first ODI.

On behalf of Vishal and Chandan, this is Saurabh Somani signing off. Don't forget to join us for the final game on Sunday - the series may be decided, but the cricket could still provide sparkle.<br><br><b>Quinton de Kock is the Player of the Match:</b> Nice to get out there and score a couple of runs for once. Lack of game-time catches up with players, so nice to be out there. The more I batted, the more I felt my rhythm was coming back. Me and Janneman have a good relationship out there. I was coming at the bowlers and he was just rotating strike to get me on strike. We have a great understanding. (Life as a father) It's been brief. Only had a chance to spend a couple of days at home. I think it's changed my view on life and just kids in general.<br><br><b>Temba Bavuma:</b> Very happy. That was the objective for us starting the series, we wanted to win the series. We weren't expecting to do it after two games. Obviously great to have Quinny back, see him smiling in the team. He reminded us again why he's such a valuable player. I think as a team we have a lot of self-belief and confidence in our ability. We go out there and fight for one another. We really try to put in a real team effort. We don't really on superstars or one or two performances. Coming into this series, no one gave us much of a chance, so that really gave us motivation. We pride ourselves in our fast bowlers, but to see the spin bowlers bringing the game home for us, that really makes us a side to be reckoned with. (captaincy) I enjoy it. Have enjoyed it since I did it at domestic cricket. I try and see how I can serve and inspire others in the team. Fortunate that there's a lot of cricket brains in the team. That's a good thing. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, they can confuse you on the field! I think 3-0 sounds a lot better than 2-1, but in saying that, we'll enjoy the win today.<br><br><b>KL Rahul:</b> They are playing some really good cricket at home and we are making mistakes as well in the middle. Good learning for us. Obviously not great to be on the losing side two games in a row. (Changes to your side?) Not with individuals but we're trying to get better at things we haven't done well in the past. I spoke about partnerships earlier. The middle order is crucial going into a big tournament. We want to get wickets in the middle, create pressure. (Pitches being subcontinental) Yes it does feel like one of the wickets at home. I don't think it was a pitch they could have chased down 280 that easily but credit to them, they batted well. They showed us the importance of partnerships and the importance of putting pressure early. (Positives) The way Virat and Shikhar batted in the first game. The way Rishabh batted today. Not easy to come in with two down. He's a really important member of the team. Shardul has been hitting the ball well at the end and he's showing us he can bat. Jasprit Bumrah is obviously phenonemenal. Continues to be the standout bowler of the team. I think the energy has been great, obviously it's really hot. Not saying it as an excuse but we haven't played 50 overs cricket in a long time. It's been tough on the body, staying in the bubbles. It's challenging, but I'm not saying we don't love challenges. Look ahead to the third game and try to win that one. Maybe a few changes, may not be, I can't say."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>6.33pm:</b> South Africa have eased to victory in remarkable fashion. The series is theirs, 2-0, with one game to play. India have looked ragged and bereft of spark and ideas, batting, bowling and fielding - with some exceptions. They would have thought before this tour that they had a good chance to win Tests and ODIs. They'll end up winning neither. A superb performance by South Africa. They didn't allow India to run away while batting - only Rishabh Pant could break free and he's pretty much out of syllabus for every bowler. Pant apart, there wasn't much cheer in the Indian batting, except for a good stand between Shardul Thakur and R Ashwin. KL Rahul will need to take a hard look at his batting approach at the top of the order. He got a fifty alright, but in a game where 288 is chased down in 48 overs, 55 off 79 won't do most times. For South Africa, the batters followed on the good work of the bowlers. Quinton de Kock was magnificent. He came out swinging, and connecting with pristine timing. Janneman Malan could afford to take his time to settle in due to de Kock's fireworks, and then he made it count too. Aiden Markram was short of runs, came out and played a nice cameo. Rassie van der Dussen just keeps piling on the runs. South Africa will be mighty pleased with this. They won the Test series as underdogs. Now they've won the ODI series as underdogs too. And they could even clean-sweep India."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":35855269,"id":35855269,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":47.06,"oversActual":47.6,"overNumber":48,"ballNumber":6,"totalRuns":0,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":142,"wagonY":195,"wagonZone":6,"timestamp":"2022-01-21T16:31:18.000Z","modified":"2022-01-21T16:31:22.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":55398,"bowlerPlayerId":54282,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":287,"totalInningWickets":3,"predictions":null,"title":"Bhuvneshwar to van der Dussen","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"and RvD offers a solid forward defensive to cover to end the over with just one needed for a win.

And there appears to be a tiny gap, so the third umpire rules the foot was in the air, and Andile has got another wicket in the fashion he did in the first ODI.

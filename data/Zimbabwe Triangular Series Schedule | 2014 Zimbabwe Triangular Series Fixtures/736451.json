But Mitchell played very well and it showed the pitch got better for batting once you spent some time there. We were found wanting in the slog overs, he deserves credit for what he pulled off there and batsmen are getting really dangerous these days. We were poor in patches. I'm not worried about the middle order. Disappointed that we lost too many wickets, including mine, at the wrong time. And we'll have to ask our batsmen to bat for longer.

They were jittery today as well but Hughes and Marsh charged them to a very competitive score on this pitch. Their bowlers never allowed South Africa to get on top. No batsman could even score 25, barring du Plessis who ran out of partners before falling for 126. Most of their bowlers chipped in and when it looked like McLaren was giving them a chance with du Plessis, Johnson broke the stand and took it away. It means Zimbabwe still have a theoretical chance to make it to the final, with a massive bonus-point win, in their last league game against South Africa.

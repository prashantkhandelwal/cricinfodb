Australia's man in touch is gone. A full delivery outside off from Pandya, Finch tries to go over mid-off, the right ball to hit, but can only skew the ball off the outside half towards Bumrah at mid-off, who rusn to his left, takes the catch, but the ball pops out. The ball is rolling all over his legs like an insect, but Bumrah uses his feel, not his sight, to hold on somehow. Made a simple catch look very tough.

Dhoni isn't generally pumped up but boy, is he animated or what? Outstanding work by Chahal. Tossed it up but slowed it down nicely, he saw Maxwell charge down so lobbed this towards middle and leg, Maxwell, who senses he may not have gotten to the pitch of the ball, looks to turn this to the leg side, but the ball deflects off his right pad as the ball went between his legs, Dhoni collects it and smashes the stumps to leave Maxwell way outside the crease.

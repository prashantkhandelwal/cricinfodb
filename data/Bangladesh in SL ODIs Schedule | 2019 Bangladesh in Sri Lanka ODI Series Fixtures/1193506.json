All the boys are ready, they're all in a good mindset. I would like to thank Bangladesh Cricket Board for coming here and giving us a chance to play a lovely series.

The wickets we played on were slow, when boundaries are big and wickets slow, you have to hit the gaps, run hard. My approach will be to try and be positive, depending on the wickets. Each and every player has to go through these pressures, senior players go through it. That's what we're trained for. Use your experience to get over it, trust your ability.

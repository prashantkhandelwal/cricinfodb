winners of the ICC Champions Trophy, and they win it for the second time. Big cheers in the Australian dressing room, the players come out to shake hands with their opponents. New Zealand tried hard, and at 6 for 2, the game was open. Watson - who's made successive centuries -  and White, however, despite their slow start, preserved their wickets and then took off. That 128-run stand was a match-winning one; just, in hindsight, how crucial was that stand between Lee and Hauritz against Pakistan! Credit to New Zealand for the way they played this tournament; that win against Sri Lanka made amends somewhat for a disappointing tour to the country and that superb bowling display against England got them to the knockout stage. Elliott and Vettori then won them the semi-final against Pakistan, but today their batting let them down.

We spoke about that before the game. We had to do that right through the series, and get contributions regularly, if we wanted to beat India in this series. There were a couple of times India got on top, but to our bowlers credit, our bowlers found a way to fight back. Johnson has been really impressive over the last couple of months, and was impressive in England too. He definitely gave us a great start. Yeah, putting on 300 was really good and we had contributions right down the order. The 100-run stand set a great platform, and Maxwell provided great impetus in the middle, with Faulkner and the bowlers hitting well at the end. It was important to have even contributions through the order. We were looking at 300 from the start so it was important we started well.

If you look at the wicket, with the time we started, it was definitely going to swing a bit, but we struggled a bit. We don't have genuine fast bowlers, more swing bowlers, so we couldn't generate the bounce that the other bowlers (Australia) did. The spinners did well, but when we finished off [the innings] we gave too much away. We had to hit the deck from the start. If you can dig it in, you get extra bounce. Spinners did well, but we have to consider the dew factor. We were in a decent position, and at one point the game was 50/50. it was important that the batsman carried on till the Powerplay. We have got the power the achieve that, but we played shots that were not really intended. That harmed us. It is important that when we chase we have to make solid partnerships.

There was a little more grass here than what we have seen from T20 cricket, but as I said, it was a good team performance. I think India showed their class the other night when they chased over 200. We put up 300 today, so we did our job. We expect a good remaining six matches to come as well."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Australia 1, India 0.

Even with a star-studded batting line-up, India were put to the sword by an excellent opening spell from Mitchell Johnson and Clint McKay, and, apart from a period when Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli were cruising, Australia looked resigned to a certain defeat. But the go-slow approach backfired in a huge way, and India paid the price.

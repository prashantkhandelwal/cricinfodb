At one point just 20 runs came off 15 overs for the loss of five Oman wickets and had the fielding been just a little sharper, Oman would have been completely becalmed. In the end had it not been for Sultan Ahmed and Amir Ali, Nepal would in all likelihood have won. A day of some upsets, Malaysia beating Afghanistan too.

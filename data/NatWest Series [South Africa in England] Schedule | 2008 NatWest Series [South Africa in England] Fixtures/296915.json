The 10-wicket win was set-up by a memorable spell from Stuart Broad, picking up 5 for 23 - his first five-for in ODIs, and in doing so he passed 50 ODI wickets. Matt Prior had a fine game behind - and, later, in front of - the stumps, snaffling six catches as South Africa were dismissed for 83, their lowest-ever total against England. For the second-placed side in the world, this was a thoroughly disappointing performance, and although they won the Test series 2-1, ever since they have lost their focus.

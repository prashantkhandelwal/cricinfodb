Definitely different surface than we thought. Starting at 10 we thought there might be a little swing. After three-four overs we changed our plan, the way the guys executed was fantastic. Great effort with the ball, and then the way the openers batted. Most pleasing thing is the learning from the first innings.

South Africa lost too many wickets too early, never coming to terms with the slowness of the pitch. New Zealand responded with a 126-run opening stand between Latham and Guptill, which settled the game.

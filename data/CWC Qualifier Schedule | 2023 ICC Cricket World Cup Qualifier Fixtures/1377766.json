(On the score) When he started batting, we felt 280-290 was going to be a good score. When we started our bowling innings, we figured out the pitch was good to bat on. Thankfully Sean Williams produced a special innings to get us up to 330 (332). (On the bowling display) The wicket did seem quite a bit different to the morning. Our bowlers missed our lengths and our lines a little bit and made it easier for Oman. (On what is a good score) It is quite tough to say. You lose the toss and you get put into bat, the first 10 overs were quite touch. We thought 280 was a good score. Obviously bowling second, we have to look at around 300-320. If the wicket is going to get better, you need a little bit extra to defend that. (Message to the team) We have been playing some really good cricket. I don't think we need to change too much.

Two days to bounce back before we face Sri Lanka."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Zeeshan Maqsood, Oman captain:</strong> (On where the game was lost) I like to start from the start. We did not do well in the field. We dropped catches, could not stop them from running twos and singles. We gave away 30-40 runs extra. In the second half, we got an amazing start. Prajapati scored a hundred - that was a plus point for us. In the middle phase, we gave away many wickets and that is why we could not come back and win the game. (On his injury) It is a hamstring. I am not sure (on when he will be fit), will need to have a look. Whenever we wanted boundaries, we were getting it. We were rotating strike also nicely. If I had not gotten injured, maybe we could have changed the game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Sean Williams, Player of the Match:</strong> (On the pitch and how he constructed his innings) It was a pretty good wicket. Slow to start off with, difficult to hit the boundaries off the seamers in particular. Felt running between the wickets was key. Tried to take the spinners on. Bowling got difficult towards the end but credit goes to our bowlers. They bowled really well towards the end. (On his mindset) Staying nice and calm is the most important thing. Running between the wickets is one of the most important things in cricket. It puts pressure on the bowler. The moment you show that intent, it puts pressure. When I first saw the wicket, I thought 270 would be a very good score. Thankfully everyone chipped in there and we got up to that total."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>5:25pm</strong> Zimbabwe eventually got past the finish line but it was not before Oman gave them a scare. Oman's run-chase was led by a superb Prajapati ton. He batted excellently, picked the gaps well and punished the loose balls. Unfortunately for Oman, they had to see their captain retire hurt mid-way through his innings - a setback that muddled their plans. By the time he came out to bat again, Oman were playing catch-up and his inability to run added to their woes. There was also a passage where Oman decided against taking singles, and while the idea might have been to hit as many boundaries as possible, it did not quite work out that way."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Zimbabwe, meanwhile, would be relatively pleased with how they closed out the game, even if they would have liked the margin of victory to be greater. Muzarabani bagged three wickets, as did Chatara. Raza was good during the middle overs too, with Ngarava's angle and bounce causing the Oman batters problems. The one aspect where Zimbabwe nudged ahead of Oman, though, was their fielding. They snaffled up half-chances and that always kept the hosts ahead of the game. Oman, in contrast, spurned a few presentable chances and ultimately ended up conceding a total that was beyond their

Sean Williams is a very experienced campaigner and it looked like he had everything under control all the way through. Losing the toss and having to bat first, those 10-15 overs was quite tricky to navigate. The wicket was a little two-paced to begin with. We did well to not lose early wicket and that gave us a bit of breathing space (towards the end and in the middle overs). Raza and Burl batted brilliantly for their 100-run stand. We did feel that we were maybe 20-30 short of what would probably be a winning score. It is always going to be tough (mentally). We have talked about treating every game and opposition the same. Today has been quite an emotional day for everybody and it is not a long time before we have to come back and play again on Monday.

If we were asked to chase (that score) before the game, we would have taken it. There will be challenges, both on and off the field. We have to make sure we harden ourselves and understand what we have to do moving forward. (Wish-list moving forward) I think it is best for us to have a day off to get all of this out of our systems and come back on Monday. We know we have our work cut out.

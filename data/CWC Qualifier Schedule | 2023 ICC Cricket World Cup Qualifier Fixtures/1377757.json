The longer you spent out there, the easier it got. We just have to keep getting better as each game comes. (On the bowling) As a team, we speak a lot about being aggressive and taking wickets. Sometimes, you can go for a few runs. Sole was outstanding today. All the way through, we managed to pick wickets. (On chances of making the Super Six) We know the importance of every game.

Afterwards, we got a partnership but then we collapsed. (On what can be done to avoid such collapses) I think we need some patience.

It was a real graft to get to that back end and get the runs flowing again. (On the conditions early) It was kind of expected that there would be a bit on offer for the bowlers. They asked a lot of questions of us. We were under pressure losing early wickets. Leask came in and took the pressure off, with Watt (doing that) at the end. It was not the sort of wicket where timing came easy. I tried to run hard and put the bowlers under pressure as much as I could, and then tried to cash in at the back end.

UAE never got going in their run-chase, losing three wickets inside the powerplay. Captain Waseem and Asif tried to rebuild but once the latter perished, UAE fell too far behind. Scotland kept chipping away through the middle overs and Sharif, who had broken the game open with Asif's dismissal, came back at the end to close out the game. Sole was also very impressive with the new ball. McMullen did not quite hit the heights he hit the other day but managed to pick up the important wicket of Mustafa. Watt, as ever, was tidy."},{"type":"HTML","html":"UAE, on the other hand, would be ruing the advantage they gave up earlier in the day when they had Scotland 48-4. Berrington produced a stellar knock to dig Scotland out but UAE were also guilty of letting the game drift. A 283-run chase always seemed a tall order, and the way UAE capitulated indicated that they had given up too many runs in the first innings."},{"type":"HTML","html":"For Scotland, this was perhaps the perfect display, barring what happened early in their batting powerplay. Their captain was back among the runs, their middle order stood up again and their bowlers did not let go of that momentum.

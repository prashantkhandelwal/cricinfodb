That USA got to 207 was all down to Shayan Jahangir's maiden ODI century. However, the target was always expected to be within  Nepal's grasp. They need a good start, which was provided by Kushal Burtel and Sharki who added 49 runs for the second wicket. Paudel and Sharki then pitched in important contributions before USA got back with a couple of wickets. However, Dipendra Singh Airee was quick off the blocks and that rubbed on Sharki, who begann playing his shots.

There was a period in the middle where we struggled. But the way Wes, Saqib and Bas finished off was incredible. (On Vikramjit's innings) We spoke to him before and told him this is where you could really stand up. Amazing to see him get his maiden hundred. (On the NRR situation and if they would have liked a bigger win) They went pretty well through the middle and then we pegged it back. They gave up the chase a little and I am not sure what happened there at the end. As a unit, we were pretty good. Klein and Aryan were exceptional. (On the chat moving forward) Obviously some results that have to go our way. We cannot do anything about it. We will prepare for our next game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Aqib Ilyas, Oman captain:</strong> (On the bowling performance) I will give credit to their batters - the way they played at the start. We thought our bowlers were good but they survived the first six overs and then they carried on the momentum. Our fielding was also weak. They pushed us really and credit goes to their batting. (Chat at half-time) The talk was that we had to chase whatever was put in front of us. We always have a positive mindset. Unfortunately, they picked wickets at the start and we could not get there. Our plan was to execute our plans and focus on our strengths. We could not execute them properly and that is why they came up on top. (On Ayaan) He played really well and it is good to get a hundred in such games. (On the experience gained) Some new guys are in the side and Oman has come up. When you play such games, that is when you know what are the positives and where we are lacking."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Mnk: \"Could you please tell what is the scenario regarding the other team's qualification?

That, though, could be immaterial if Zimbabwe win against Scotland. If that happens, Zimbabwe will seal a World Cup spot alongside Sri Lanka, with both Scotland and the Netherlands going out. However, if Scotland win, the Netherlands will have a chance, provided they defeat Scotland by a big enough margin to usurp the Scots' NRR. Lots of permutations and combinations as always but long story short, Netherlands need plenty to go their way in what remains of this tournament."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Vikramjit Singh is the Player of the Match for his 109-ball 110:</strong> (How he is feeling) Amazing. I waited a long time for this, finally getting my maiden ODI hundred, feels unreal. (On the conditions) We knew it was going to do a bit at the start. (Batting plans) Batting long, and as long as I can. Everything will then take care of itself. We wanted to look out for the first 15 overs and then we batted the way we normally do."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>5:12pm</strong> Well, that turned into a fairly one-sided contest. Oman were always on the back foot, chasing 360-plus but they did not particularly ace the powerplay, losing two crucial wickets. Ayaan threatened to keep them afloat and managed to notch up his maiden century but it always felt his knock would go in vain."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Netherlands, meanwhile, would be happy with how they bowled. They did not give much away, with Dutt epitomizing their tidy display. He ended up picking three wickets, with the rest of their bowlers chipping in. In an ideal world, the Dutch would have wanted to win by a bigger margin and would have wanted to swell their NRR. But they would not be too displeased with these two points, which keeps them in the hunt for a World Cup berth."},{"type":"HTML","html":"The umpires are now having a discussion with the Netherlands captain and the batters, perhaps regarding the fading light, <strong>and it looks like they are shaking hands now.

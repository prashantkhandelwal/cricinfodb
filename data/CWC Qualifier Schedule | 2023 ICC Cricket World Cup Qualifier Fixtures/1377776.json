We knew what we wanted to do; we just needed a couple of batters to cash in towards the backend.

They run really well between the wickets. But again, yeah, we probably just missed the mark a little bit. Obviously, it was a different sort of wicket. As we saw in the first Innings, it's been a couple of games played in this surface so it wasn't as much swing today. So it's slightly different tactics. Yeah, maybe through that middle stage, we slid away from those plans which just sort of got them back into the game. Yeah, like obviously it's a really tough one but I think looking over the whole tournament, we can be very proud of some of the cricket we've played. And certainly some good building blocks, we can keep improving.

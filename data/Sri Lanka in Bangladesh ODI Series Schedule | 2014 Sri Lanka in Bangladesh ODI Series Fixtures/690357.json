Just a bit of advice when he [Priyanjan] lost his focus. Keep it simple and don't throw it away. There are time to take risks but then we needed a partnership. He's a good player for us and if he gets his focus clear, he's going to be a player to watch. No secret, just good focus, working hard in the nets.

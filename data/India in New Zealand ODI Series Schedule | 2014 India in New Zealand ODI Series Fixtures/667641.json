It was good to see some partnerships throughout the batting. Ross and Kane's stand in particular was important for our side. I was pretty pleased with how Corey went as well. So pleased with the batters. It's a captain's nightmare when you have those two guys there, but the message was simple, try to find a way to get a wicket. I thought Mitch was outstanding, and I thought Milne was really good tonight, despite the injury. Yeah our ground fielding was pretty good, and that is what we pride ourselves in."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>MS Dhoni, India captain</b>: I think overall it was a good decision to bat first. It had to be backed by good bowling. We didn't' do well in first three/four overs, but then we came back well. It was important for the spinners to bowl with control, while the seamers were not so consistent with their lengths. We were in the game, right till the end, but the wickets of Kohli, Jadeja and me that hurt us. It was important that one of us carried on till the end. We could have targeted the runs at the end, but we ran out of overs. We had good time to prepare ourselves. I think a few of the batsmen played well today, but it is important that if you get a decent start you push on to a big score.

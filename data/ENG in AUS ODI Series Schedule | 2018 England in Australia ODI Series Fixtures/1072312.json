We were chasing prob 30 too many, batted well but not enough to get over the line. [Dismissal?] It got given out, so I had to get off the field, wasn't hitting it very well anyway, gave some other guys a chance and they almost got us home.

Chris and I tried to push on, we were looking at 270 but we had a couple of good overs.

On a two-paced wicket, he paced it to perfection, played the anchor until about five or six overs out. We thought 300 was competitive, to have a hammer blow with one of the quicks going down hurt us a lot actually. This is one of the best wins from this group. With our bowling efforts, everybody was required to give a bit extra and everyone did. With the ball we were outstanding.

going to review the not out decision. Amir sent down another sharp bouncer that rose rapidly on Latham, who was trying to hook from his crease. There is no conclusive deviation, though it looks like one. Hot Spot doesn't show anything as the ball whizzes past the glove. There is a blip on the real time snicko though. Pakistan were super confident of their appeal. The third umpire decides that the spike on real time snicko is enough to overturn the decision.

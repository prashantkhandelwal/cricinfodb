Kyle Mayers and Shamarh Brooks were going along at break-neck speed before Mayers' impetuousness got the better of him as Mohammad Wasim cleaned him up. 71 for 2 soon became 72 for 3 as spin started to have a say. Mohammad Nawaz was brilliant through the middle taking career best figures of four for 19, becoming the first Pakistan bowler since Mohammad Hafeez in 2011 to concede less than 20 runs in his full quota in an ODI.  With both spinners spinning the ball away from the right handers, the onus was on Nicholas Pooran to make a contribution, but he couldn't capitalise on his start as he fell to a beauty from Nawaz for 25. Thereon, West Indies were staring down the barrel, and the lower order folded without making much of an impression to give Pakistan an unassailable two-nil lead in the series.

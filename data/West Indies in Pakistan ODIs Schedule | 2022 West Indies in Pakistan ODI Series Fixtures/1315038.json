Lovely gesture by the captain."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Time for presentation. First up <b>Nicholas Pooran</b>, the West Indies captain: [On the loss] Yes, obviously losing sucks, but today I am really proud of the guys, the way they came out and batted the 50 overs, getting 300 plus in tough conditions. It was really hot today as well. Pakistan is a world class team, Babar showed his class, Imam played a top innings and Khushdil coming at the end winning the game for them. Very proud of the guys, they gave it all. We could have been on the other side but that's cricket. [On the bowling plans] We tried to swing the ball upfront, but there was no swing, so we tried to bowl more slower balls, more into the pitch. The wicket was really good in the night as well. It seemed the game could have gone anyway even in the last four overs. We are young team and we move forward from here. [On Shai Hope] He continued to show his class, he is one of the best batsman in the format. Well played to him and even Shamarh Brooks. Tough conditions and they showed their class. So, well done to them."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Furqan: \"Khushdil firing on all cylinders is a mouth watering prospect..!!! \""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Wajid Jawaid: \"Significant work done by Pakistan's middle and lower-middle order in this victory.

Fakhar Zaman fell early but Babar Azam and Imam ul Haq steadied the ship well adding 103 runs. Imam fell going for  needless reverse sweep for 65 before Mohammad Rizwan and Babar stitched another important stand. Babar reached his century and Rizwan his fifty but the required rate continued to surge. Pakistan lost both Babar and Rizwan in quick succession but Khushdil, who is known for his six-hitting prowess, slammed three sixes in a row to settle the nerves. He eventually finished on 41 off 23 balls, with Nawaz striking the end blow. The West Indies bowlers kept things tight, but their inexperience showed in a few areas and that brought about their undoing.

Maqsood is a free stroke player and we need his kind of talent in the pressure overs and Powerplay. Told him to take his chances but he couldn't' connect. It happens in this game. By the time I came from the West Indies, my captain really supported me throughout. We haven't been clicking much the last few series. The way the management is treating us, and the way Moin <i>bhai</i> has been handling us, it has gone a long way in helping our belief after we lost series in the UAE. Those guys are doing a tremendous job off the field and have supported us. It's very pleasing for any opening batsman to make a hundred in SA. Sometimes it's really quick, sometimes it is two-paced, so it is especially pleasing to do well in these conditions."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan captain</b>: Honestly speaking the game was escaping out of our hands, but in the end we came back in the last two overs to win this. Superb team effort. Everyone really stuck in. The runs stopped and the catches held at the end was important. The way Ajmal bowled well at the end. Junaid was tremendous with his first four and then last five. Team wanted this victory and the way, even of the last ball, was the way they were fighting. That was the key for us in this game.  Two, three games in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, we should have won easily, but they really bowled well and played better than us. Maybe different attitude, but the attitude was the difference here. Everybody wants to win here. We want to prove to the world we can win the series and show the world we are better. We will sit together to see what we can achieve in the final game (dead rubber)."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>AB de Villiers, South Africa captain</b>: Close but not across the line. A couple of runs there would have stopped you from asking a lot of good questions. Just not good enough, we lost the series and I am disappointed. The most disappointing thing was when we had the game in the pocket when I was out with Hash. We got out when we shouldn't have and gave the game away. We lost momentum. Had the game in the pocket. When you have the game done and dusted, don't give the game to the opposition, especially one as world-class as this. Not a lot pleased me in the first half. Thought we were not disciplined with the ball and our ground fielding. We haven't shown our ground fielding skills so far this series which is worrying and we have to work on that. After losing the series there are a lot of questions to be asked. A lot of believers in the side and system and we will come back."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Join us in a few minutes for quotes from the <b>match presentation</b>."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Junaid has taken Pakistan to a famous victory in its limited-overs history as a superb last over from Junaid Khan ensured the visitors just held on to a 1-run victory. It wouldn't have been amiss if, just a few overs back, you thought South Africa were cruising to victory, especially when Amla and AB were going great guns. But those late wickets, and needless from AB and Amla, hurt them in a big way. Pakistan are lucky to escape with victory when you consider how poorly they had bowled in patches, and were let down in the field by their fielders. This has been a match for the ages, and with that Pakistan, crucially, wrap up the series as they take an unassailable 2-0 lead with just one rubber to go. South Africa have squandered yet another home ODI series, and the boys in the dressing room know that."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":{"team":{"id":3,"objectId":3,"scribeId":3,"slug":"south-africa","name":"South Africa","longName":"South

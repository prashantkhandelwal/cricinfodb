Agar bowled a superb spell of left-arm spin and finished with 2 for 31 in 10 overs before contributing with a very handy 19 not out to hold up an end for Wade to seal the chase as they clinched the game with an unbroken 54-run fifth-wicket stand.

It's always nice to do it in the last game of a series. We really wanted to win a series being away from a long time, being cooped up in your rooms, you just want to come out and win a series. Personally it's very pleasing but I'm much happier to go celebrate with the boys later. It's very special. Really difficult conditions, really interesting style of cricket that was played.

For us it has been challenging. We accept that we haven't batted well throughout this series.

We're not going to make excuses. We accept that we batted badly but I don't think the scores that we have gotten in this three-match series, with two top international teams, I think that's very embarrassing for us as a people. Coming from St Lucia to this, I think it's absolutely ridiculous.</b> It was plain for the world to see. If I continue going on about it, it's going to be headlines, 'Pollard this, Pollard that.' That's fine with me. But the reality is, we as players sometimes we get the brunt of the accusations and all the bad stuff. But give guys the opportunity to come and play on some good cricketing wickets. It goes back even to our regional cricket as well. I think as a whole we need to do better and we as individuals need to do better as well. So we're not going to cast blame. We're going to accept responsibility as well. But I think as a holistic approach and holistic view to move forward. You can use depleted, you can use second string, but this Australian team, these guys are passionate about their cricket.

It's a point of difference of mine is being left-arm and being able to bowl at a decent click for most of the game. So that's part of my role in the team and something that I try to continue to do. It helps when I've got Josh at the other end who is so consistent all the time and the spinning quality that we have as well. A lot of things went pretty well for us tonight. I think we learned from the other night where we got outplayed on the conditions and Matty Wade went well for us with the bat.

It was a little bit ugly tonight but you've got to get a total like that a little bit ugly when the wicket is doing a fair bit and we bounced back from the other night. We understood the conditions and for the batters to score 150, it was a great target to get. It's pretty nice to throw the new ball to Hazlewood and Starc. Ashton Agar coming into the group was fantastic today. Adam Zampa throughout the last 24 months has been brilliant. Ashton Turner did a great job as well in these conditions.

What a gem!</b> Turner is bowling very wide of the crease around the stumps, Hope tried to seize on the angle using his feet thinking he was protected from lbw and hitting with the spin, but Turner gets the length perfect on this delivery dragging it back a fraction with Hope telegraphing his charge. Hope doesn't get anywhere close to the pitch, it spins inside his attempted on drive and knocks back middle.

I think both teams tonight, spin is a threat on these type of wickets. I think the way Matt Wade and Starc combatted that, Adam Zampa had a plan against them. I suppose with the newer ball it might spin and bounce a bit more so we need to get through those first overs against the spinners. A great effort again to get to 190 and we were definitely in the game. I thought the bowlers did a fantastic job. At five down, we had an opportunity to crack it open again. We definitely created enough to stay in the game. Bring on game three. The batting group has a bit to prove to get a good score on the board for our quicks but our quicks and spinners are doing a great job.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>West Indies captain Kieron Pollard:</b> \"It's pleasing to win. Obviously when you start a cricket match you want to win, but to say I'm overall pleased with our performance throughout the entire game, I think we have some work to do. Having Australia [45 for 6] and they getting 190, I thought we didn't put our foot on the X. They getting to 190, we gave them an opportunity to come into the game. Our batters didn't make it easy as well. It seems like we don't like to do things the easy way. The spinners were fantastic. Hosein coming up trumps again, Walshy hard work continues to pay off. The start that we got, getting a couple wickets early was fantastic by the bowlers. But as I said, 180-190 I think is a bit disappointing on our part to be totally honest. Australia have world-class bowlers. What was good this time around was the fight by the guys, Nicholas Pooran getting that half-century and Jason Holder as well. Pooran has been looking like his old self again. He was a bit scratchy tonight but sometimes that's what you need in a game like this. You want someone to scrap and I think they both scrapped well for us to come through for a victory. It's a Catch-22 situation with [Jason Mohammed]. Obviously Jason is playing a role where if you lose a couple wickets, you want him to bat long. From a Super50 perspective he has done well. Chase normally does that for us. When you look at the makeup of our team and me coming back not being able to bowl, he gives us that sixth bowling option. We will look at it as a team and come up with our best combination to play this third game.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"West Indies move past Ireland up into a tie with Pakistan for fifth place on the Super League points table at 40 points.

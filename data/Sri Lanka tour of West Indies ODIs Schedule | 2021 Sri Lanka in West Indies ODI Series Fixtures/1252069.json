I think that's a slower one, and that's Chameera's pace on the other balls that's created this dismissal. Hope is through the shot early, as this ball pitches full and just outside off stump, coming in with the angle. It goes on to clip the outside of off, and Hope's wonderful innings has to end. I think that ball deviated away off the surface slightly to beat the shot.

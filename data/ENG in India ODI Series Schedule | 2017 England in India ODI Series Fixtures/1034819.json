That spell where he didn't go for many and took Buttler's wicket was the difference between 350 and 370. Then Kohli's supreme belief stands out.

In front of his parents, his wife, his daughter, playing an innings only young boys not bogged down by the realities of life have the innocence to dream of. And that innings was like a dream.

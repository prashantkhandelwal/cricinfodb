It was a great demo for the Champions Trophy,\"<b>Virat Kohli says</b>, \"Jadhav is brilliant find for us. We've backed him over the last year, he hasn't had many games, but he is coming into his own, he gives Yuvi and Dhoni the chance ot bat higher and he reads the game well, its priceless and Hardik is coming into his own as allrounder as well. The moment I saw the pitch I thought it was the perfect scenario for the Champions Trophy. The batsman had to show character and getting as close as five runs gives us a lot of confidence. The key for us will be the lengths we bowl. We've been playing at home for a while. Even here we weren't sure. That's one area we would look to address, what are the areas we need to hit to get batsmen out.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Finally, it;s been hard work in a very competitive series. Today we were rewarded for our persistent drive to win,\" <b>Eoin Morgan says</b>, \"They did, it was similar to an English wicket and when you lose the toss, you have to do it the hard way and the dew was very tough to deal with. Jason Roy and Sam Billings did well at the top of the order for us. The bowlers make the captain look good. Giving a wicket that offered more helped them and actually rewarded them for good, discipline line and length. We were always open to what we wanted to do. The bowler has his options as well. The first couple of balls went for six and four, but his third and fourth deliveries were on the money and like I said, we did it the hard way. I think because there was bounce and carry, when you hit a good length, there was something on offer. So we encouraged them to hit the wicket hard and try and extract anything in there. Huge positives. India outplayed us in the first two games but this win was important. You can try hard but without wins it damages the team's confidence\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Kedar Jadhav is the Man of the Series</b> for his 232 runs in three matches. \"I was planning to play all six balls, I knew if I could do that the bowler will be under pressure.

Specially if you pitch it up there was some movement and that is why I didn't want to come forward, I wanted to stay back and with the dew, I knew normal shots will get me boundaries. First game when I was in the middle, with Virat, this is the time where you can learn how to finish games and that is what I told Hardik as well.

Went down to the last ball, and though there were over 600 runs made in the day, the bowlers were in with a shout as well. The new ball decked around. Even the old one did as the Eden Gardens pitch offered pace, bounce and sideways movement. You'd think this would be good practice for both teams for the Champions Trophy in the UK, but then again ODIs there tend to be played on flat decks. Not the green meanies seen in the Tests. Anyway, England's victory - much of it at least - has to be down to the Stokes effect. Hit a composed half-century in the first innings to push the total above par and then his bowling in the death provided the wickets (3-63) at the right time. Moeen's tight overs in the middle helped, especially with David Willey hurting his bowling shoulder and going off the field after only two overs.

We will be in a better place to make the decision in Taunton. There are 10 ways to get out and run out was one of them. They bowled very well to Warner and he need some more time.

You can't take things for granted just because you have 350 on the board. I held one up and Hardik could go from ball one. If Shami plays, it has to be proper overcast and bowling conditions.

Santner holds his nerve to take New Zealand home. Heart break for Bangladesh and New Zealand go on top of the table. Both teams tried to outdo each other's errors and eventually Bangladesh succeeded. That's not to discredit a dramatic comeback by the bowlers, but it would not have been possible without the help of some of the New Zealand batsmen who gifted their wickets away. In the end, It was always going to be a game of what iffs after Bangladesh squandered numerous run-out chances offered by the pair of Taylor and Williamson, Mushfiqur botching up sensationally as he knocked off the bails with his elbow in his eagerness to collect Tamim's throw which was headed for the middle stump to reprieve Williamson. The running got better, Taylor was in sublime form and Williamson nudged to ball into gaps to keep things ticking. They lost their way thereafter as Bangladesh kept striking back and made a real match of it but that 105-run stand between Taylor and Williamson had knocked off a major chunk of the target and the tail just about wagged to take them home."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":29402227,"id":29402227,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":46.08,"oversActual":46.6,"overNumber":47,"ballNumber":8,"totalRuns":4,"batsmanRuns":4,"isFour":true,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":143,"wagonY":2,"wagonZone":8,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2019-06-05T20:09:46.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":64402,"bowlerPlayerId":70884,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":244,"totalInningWickets":8,"predictions":null,"title":"Saifuddin to Ferguson","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>that virtually seals the game!</strong> Agony for Bangladesh as he the full one fine and into the third-man boundary.

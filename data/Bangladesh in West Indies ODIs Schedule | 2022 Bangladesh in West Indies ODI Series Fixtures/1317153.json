We spoke yesterday the ways to score, you saw the guys sweep and reverse today but it didn't come out. At the moment we are still figuring it out, we are a young group, we are gonna stick together and try our best. On India and New Zealand touring, we definitely need to bat properly, 100%, and put something respectable total on board  and again it's a young team we are playing together, the more games we play the more we understand how to go about it and again, stick together and try to bat second.

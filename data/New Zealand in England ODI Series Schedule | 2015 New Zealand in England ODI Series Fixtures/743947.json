The final margin closer than it really was after the hundreds by Williamson and Taylor. England will be left to rue a wasteful day; five overs not batted and dropped catches. Another enjoyable ODI on another good pitch, with just a little bit more for the bowlers - but not much.

We looked like getting 350+ and that's exciting. What cost us was Kane and Ross' partnership, and we couldn't break it. We've taken the overs out of the equation, we were aiming for a lot more which is important. We could have held our disciplines [with the ball] better, but it was a very good wicket. We'll assess how we can come back stronger. Wood and Willey were outstanding. We set the bar high in the field and have been a bit below that. We did a lot of things right with the bat today.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Brendon McCullum</b> \"This game we were under a lot of pressure but the way responded in the last 10 overs was a good sign. Sometimes we can try a bit too hard and sometimes you just need to back yourself, take a breath and know your skills will stand up. I the end our thought our bowling was pretty good on a 320-330 wicket. Trent is a massive loss to us but Ben had a nice poise about him. Kane and Ross just keep churning out results for us. We did what we needed to to win the game.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"The Man of the Match is <b>Kane Williamson</b> for his hundred and wicket of Morgan. \"That partnership in the middle was key, but it was so important to bowl England out.

Ross has been outstanding, his contribution was massive.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"That just about wraps things up for today.

We also need to take initiative and play attacking cricket. After 17 years of struggle, Abid Ali showed his class in the last game. Same as Rizwan.

My own process didn't change a lot, I've just changed a couple of things technically over the last couple of weeks. They didn't quite work at first, but when you try new things they take some time. It was tough. India had the better of me. Khawaja, his last couple of months in white ball cricket have been great, and he lead from the front in india. I was disappointed he didn't get a hundred here, he played a great knock. There's always room for improvement. One real  positive it the way our spinners have bowled.

Very poor batting display on a surface like this but we have to move on to the next one. They are the no.1 team and these are the reasons. They have three world class bowlers who are making things easier for them. We have been doing well in the bowling department but batting is a bit hot and cold. We need to be more consistently. I thought our three seamers bowled brilliantly. Like Pakistan, our seamers have been bowling very well in the last couple of years. But unfortunately on a pitch like this you can't get wickets unless batters make mistakes. [On playing in SL] When I played in LPL, pitches were a bit slow, wickets were a little up and down and that should help us.

Haris Rauf set it up with his excellent four-wicket haul, helped by Naseem who took three. Imam stayed steady despite a great opening spell from Shoriful, surviving quite a few lbw appeals. Fakhar, who started positively before slowing down, eventually was trapped lbw by Shoriful. Babar fell to Taskin soon, but Rizwan joined Imam and the two ensured Pakistan did not suffer any further hiccups. Imam got to a fine fifty and got out trying to up the tempo. By the time he departed for 78, Pakistan had the match in the bag.

The last touch before your first contact with the ball after it's hit by the batter has to be inside the boundary rope.

My plan was to play as late as possible. I was waiting for the ball to come to me and I did not go forward. I was in rhythm and continued my basic things. I was trying to bat deep and my plan was to get the 250 for the team because I knew the wicket was going to help the spinners.

When there's no frontline bowlers so someone needs to chip in and today was my day. Maheesh wasn't able to bowl up front but at the end, Maheesh bowled in the end and in the end the result matters.

Those two wickets led to two more quick wickets. And then, with Hridoy building a 72-run stand with Mushfiqur, Shanaka came back to break that stand as well.

We needed 80-100 run partnership to chase this. Our top four didn't get enough runs and we didn't bowl well at the start. [On Hridoy] He batted really well. He played LPL here so he brought that confidence. He played really well. If he could have batted a little longer, but then there are always a lot of ifs and buts.

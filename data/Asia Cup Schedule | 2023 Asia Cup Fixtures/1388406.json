And yes, then after that I stepped up where I could. I take a lot of pride in fitness. Pushing for doubles are easy runs, compared to a big shot. It has paid off before, hope to continue in the same way. (Partnership... was classical.) Both KL and myself are both conventional players. And when you have him batting the way he was and me playing, its tough to break these partnerships because we don't play fancy shots. We didn't think about the partnership too much, the idea was to 'keep batting.' It is one of the memorable partnerships we've had and for Indian cricket as well. He hit form for us straightaway, good for us. (Another game in a few hours) Its the first time I have done anything like this in 15 years of cricket. Luckily we are Test players, so we know how to come back the next day and play. Recovery is crucial. It was humid out there today. I am 35 in November, so I need to take care of my recovery.

There are so many people around the ground who wanted to make sure the game happened. (Big batting numbers today) It was a fantastic batting performance, right from yesterday. When we started, we knew the wicket was good. With interruptions you have to adjust, but with two experienced batters in the middle, we knew they'd get their eye in and then terrific effort from both. (Bowling - Kuldeep, Bumrah...) Bumrah looked good. We all saw that. wung the ball both ways. Really worked hard for the past 8-15 months. I know how hard it is who goes through that kind of injury. Bumrah is only 27. For him to come back... the way he bowled, he's shown what Bumrah is all about. Good to see him in that rhythm. (Boxes ticked?) Looking at how we batted, there were lot of positives.

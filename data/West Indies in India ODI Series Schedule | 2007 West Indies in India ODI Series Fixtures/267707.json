Daren Powell took 4 for 27 in a single, miserly ten-over spell as West Indies bowled India out cheaply, with only Karthik and Agarkar offering much resistance.

Dravid comes up to the podium and tells Arun Lal that winning another game is great, especially against West Indies, and he singles out Karthik and Agarkar, and the bowlers. He admits it wasnt the greatest track to play on, but observes that everyone knew their roles and that it was a unified win. Karthik picks up the Man-of-the-Match award for his 87-ball 63, a great resurrection act, and he'd doused in water and Gatorade as he collects his cheque and little trophy. Arun Lal slips up and refers to him as Dinesh Mongia! All is well, and a soaked Karthik beams as he expresses his satisfaction at chipping in with another good effort his side, especially since he's far from a regular in the side. He praises Agarkar for his cool head and ability to capitalise on bad balls."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Well, thats all we have for you tonight, folks.

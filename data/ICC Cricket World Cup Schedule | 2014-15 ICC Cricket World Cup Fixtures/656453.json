There was some variable bounce, it was doing a bit. It settled down later, there was some swing for the West Indies bowlers as well, with the new ball. Our bowlers didn't try too much, they stuck to their line and length, it had a bit more bounce, gave quite a few wides bowling bouncers, but we also got wickets with the bouncer, so very happy with our performance. It is a difficult target, because you don't know whether to go and play your shots. It was a good chance to test out lower middle order. Ashwin played well, Jadeja will have to step up, I feel. The last time we were in New Zealand, there were true wickets, we'll have to see what kind of wickets are provided, but generally the ball comes on, there is some bounce.

Even generally, it's always rankled me that players aren't simply allowed to speak in the language they're most comfortable in, and take an interpreter along.

I don't know if that would have made any difference to the result, but it made things awfully simple for Dhoni and Ashwin.

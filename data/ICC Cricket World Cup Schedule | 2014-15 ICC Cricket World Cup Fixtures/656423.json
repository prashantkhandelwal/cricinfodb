We just have to regroup as a batting unit and work hard on our game. I still thought it was a good toss to win. It was one of those where you wanted to bat first and put a team under pressure who had fielded in the heat, but still no excuses. We lost Vernon and I needed Parny's overs. Otherwise I'd have ended up bowling again. We just didn't bat well enough.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>MS Dhoni</b>: I think more than just the result, it was how we played. Back to back performances by both the bowling and batting units. South Africa are a very good side, so one more complete performance. We can only speculate how important the toss was. We were able to swing the ball under lights. The bowlers bowled in good areas, and even Jadeja bowled very well, not just quick and flat the way he usually bowls. Very pleased with the run-outs. We usually see the oppositions taking on our fast bowlers in the deep. Mohit and Umesh are quite fast and have good arms. What's happening really well is we are able to execute our plans. I can give fields to the fast bowlers. They are not bowling loose balls. They bowled tight lines and the batsmen had to play big shots to get runs. The amount of effort the fast bowlers are putting in the nets is beginning to show now.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Shikhar Dhawan is the man of the match</b>. \"I would say it's a great feeling,\" he says. \"It was important that the partnerships were going big for my team. That was my plan. We lost the early wicket today, AB hit a great run out. Just wanted to stay at the wicket, respected the good balls. I was relaxed, I knew once set I could bring up the run rate again. After 20-25th over I was in, and I knew I could get boundaries easily. [Kohli and Rahane] batted beautifully. Virat at the start when we were under pressure, gave the stability, and Jinky started on a good note, and his strike rate was good so I could relax at the other end.\" Thanks the crowd specifically before walking off."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Ribhav Bansal: \"This is India's 2nd biggest win against a Test nation at the World Cup. Also, India have never lost an ODI when Dhawan has scored a century, has happened all 7 times.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>9.52pm</b> India have won by 130 runs. No one would have predicted this at the start, and not even after they got 307. But they bowled with discipline with the new ball, the spinners chipped in, and the fielding was excellent. The partnership between AB and Faf kept South Africa in the hunt, but the run out of AB changed the game completely, and the rest of the batting folded without too much resistance. India have won two massive games, and their net run rate will reflect it. South Africa have a few issues to sort out, particularly with who they want to occupy that No. 7 slot. It's South Africa's biggest defeat in a World Cup game, and India's third-biggest win over them in ODIs."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":12918859,"id":12918859,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":40.02,"oversActual":40.1,"overNumber":41,"ballNumber":2,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":1,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":230,"wagonY":190,"wagonZone":3,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":50121,"bowlerPlayerId":49247,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":177,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Jadeja

Progression of Teams\n\n21.10.1 Pool Matches\n\nThe following point system will apply:\n\nWin 2<br>\nTie, No Result or Abandoned 1<br>\nLoss 0\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points in its Pool, the right to play in the quarter-finals will be decided in the following order of priority:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The team with the most wins in the Pool matches will be placed in the higher position.\n<li>If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the Pool matches then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the Pool matches will be placed in the higher position (refer to 21.10.5 below for the calculation of net run rate).\n<li>If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head to head matches played between them (points then net run rate in those matches).\n<li>In the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated by the above, teams will be ordered according to their original seed-ing.\n<li>If all matches within a Pool are a no result, the top four seeded teams will progress to the quarter-finals.\n</ul>\n\n21.10.2 Quarter Final\n\nIf a quarter-final is tied, abandoned or if the match is a no result, then the team that finished in the higher position in the Pool stage shall proceed to the semi-finals.\n\n21.10.3 Semi Final\n\nIf a semi-final is tied, abandoned or if the match is a no result, then the team that finished in the higher position in the Pool stage shall proceed to the final.\n21.10.4 Final\n\nIn the event of a tied final, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team is the winner.\n\nIf following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match is abandoned or a no result, the teams shall be declared joint winners.\n\n21.10.5 Net Run Rate\n\nA team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Pool

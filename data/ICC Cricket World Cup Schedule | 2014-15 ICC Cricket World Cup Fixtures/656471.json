Sometimes you are not always going to be on. I thought our awareness and our attention in the field could have been improved. This was more of a subcontinental wicket than a NZ, or Australian one, but it is good to still pull through with the win. I cut my hands a couple of times (diving in the field), but we have to be desperate in the field. It is an attitude we need to bring to the table. If we are serious about going deep, we got to keep it up. It doesn't bother us who we play next.

He is in great form (Mahmudullah), but he needs to keep going on. He is in great touch. Some of our boys are in good nick and are scoring runs regularly. Hopefully they can keep producing with both the bat and all. We just needed to get some early wickets, but then they scored more runs. It was hard for us as we were a bowler short.

Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was

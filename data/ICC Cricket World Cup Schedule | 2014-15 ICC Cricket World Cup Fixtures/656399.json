We sincerely hope you enjoyed our coverage of this first match of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup.

We have been waiting a long time for this so it is great to complete our plans. I thought it might swing so I also thought about bowling first. The wicket was a bit on the slow side, but there was definitely good bounce and carry. It was great to lay the foundation and then allow the bigger hitters to come in and do the job. We look forward to the next game now, but it is great to beat a very tough Sri Lanka team. It is really pleasing to use cross-seamers and pitch the ball on the fourth/fifth stump lines were really good. I thought Boult and Milne came back really well and looked to be searching for wickets, so we were pretty pleased with how those guys played. Daniel Vettori was brilliant as always. Milne is a great weapon to have in the team, and I suspect he might just go the way of that tweet (when asked if Milne is the next Shane Bond.)"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka captain</b>: We knew it was going to be a good wicket so we knew we had to bowl well, but they started off poorly, and by that time it was too late. Especially after the start they got when they reached 100 in the 13th over. We did reasonably well to pull them back, but we gave up 30-40 runs too many. Once we lost the big guys at the top it became tougher on the rest of the guys. You need someone in the top four to get a biggie when you are chasing down a 300+ score. Malinga will get better and better and we all know what kind of bowler he is, so he will come back strong."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>6.58 pm</b>: We are expecting some more quotes from the <b>match presentation</b>, so don't go anywhere just yet!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Corey Anderson, Man of the Match</b>: It's nice to come back home and play in front of family and friends.

I always have a different plan when I go out to bat, and it turns out differently in the middle. We just wanted to turn that par total into a winning total. Brendon held me back for a little bit till the end, so it was good to get a bowl, but the other bowlers really set the tone, especially Dan who just took them out of the game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Corey Anderson is the Man of the Match"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>6.52 pm</b>: It is all over folks. New Zealand take the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup tournament opener by beating Sri Lanka by an impressive 98 runs. This victory has been shaped by many hands, with Vettori proving the trump card for Brendon with his ten overs going for just 2 for 34. Other NZ seamers chipped in with vital strikes as well, but his spell set the tone for the innings. Sri Lanka looked increasingly composed as they managed their chase early on, but once the top order began to fall away, the rest of the batting came undone, and predictably, they folded under the pressure of a mounting required rate. The good news for Sri Lankan fans though, is that Dilshan, Sangakkara and now Mathews have earned some valuable time in the middle, and that should hopefully bode them well for the remainder of the tournament."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":12818431,"id":12818431,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":46.01,"oversActual":46.1,"overNumber":47,"ballNumber":1,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":1,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":8460,"bowlerPlayerId":51057,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":233,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Anderson to Herath","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Anderson back into the fold now"}],"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"tests the third umpire's patience with a shorter one, but Llong is having none of it"}],"commentPostTextItems":null,"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":12818403,"id":12818403,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":45.07,"oversActual":45.6,"overNumber":46,"ballNumber":7,"totalRuns":0,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":46995,"bowlerPlayerId":49108,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":232,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Southee to Lakmal","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"tries him from round the wicket now as he plays at this fuller one, but is late on it as it goes across"}],"commentPostTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Gokul: \"McCullam, Williamson and Corey in the fantasy team, with Corey as the Captain..

Progression of Teams\n\n21.10.1 Pool Matches\n\nThe following point system will apply:\n\nWin 2<br>\nTie, No Result or Abandoned 1<br>\nLoss 0\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points in its Pool, the right to play in the quarter-finals will be decided in the following order of priority:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The team with the most wins in the Pool matches will be placed in the higher position.\n<li>If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the Pool matches then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the Pool matches will be placed in the higher position (refer to 21.10.5 below for the calculation of net run rate).\n<li>If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head to head matches played between them (points then net run rate in those matches).\n<li>In the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated by the above, teams will be ordered according to their original seed-ing.\n<li>If all matches within a Pool are a no result, the top four seeded teams will progress to the quarter-finals.\n</ul>\n\n21.10.2 Quarter Final\n\nIf a quarter-final is tied, abandoned or if the match is a no result, then the team that finished in the higher position in the Pool stage shall proceed to the semi-finals.\n\n21.10.3 Semi Final\n\nIf a semi-final is tied, abandoned or if the match is a no result, then the team that finished in the higher position in the Pool stage shall proceed to the final.\n21.10.4 Final\n\nIn the event of a tied final, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team is the winner.\n\nIf following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match is abandoned or a no result, the teams shall be declared joint winners.\n\n21.10.5 Net Run Rate\n\nA team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Pool

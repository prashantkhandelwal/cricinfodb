They bowled exceptionally well a the end, credit to them in the last 10 overs. After 35 overs we were in a great position but they took it away at the end. With the short boundary, once you get in you can really cash in. They batted extremely well. That partnership between Marcus and Shaun was outstanding to give us a chance to launch. If we'd been at that point two down we'd have been a chance, but not to be.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Faf du Plessis</b> \"It's good, I thought we played our best game of cricket. We challenged ourselves to put in a performance. A high pressure game. From a batting point of view we were, but from a death-bowling point of view we were excellent. Really good that we could get tested against two set batsmen and the way we responded was great to see. Myself and Dave had to somehow get a score together, we talked about trying to get to 240 but with Dave's power we were able to get going. We'll remember this place fondly.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"So the series win to South Africa and they deserved it. A few things for Australia to take with them in their rebuilding, but they have a distance to go in one-day cricket. They won't play 50 overs again until January against India as they switch back to T20 mode before the Tests. There is a one-off T20 between these two sides on Saturday and we'll be back to bring you the action.

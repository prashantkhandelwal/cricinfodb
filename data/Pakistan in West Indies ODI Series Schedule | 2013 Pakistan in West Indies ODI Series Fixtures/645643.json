Those are pretty serious quotes from Bravo about \"key decisions\". He has not uttered the word \"umpire\", but it no mystery what he is talking about. I am not going to comment whether what he is saying is right or wrong - you can always go back and read our ball-by-ball commentary - but this could get him into trouble with the ICC. I can still see Ottis Gibson have a long chat with the match referee David Boon. Possibly he is trying to understand on what basis was Darren Bravo given out but not Misbah. They seemed pretty similar cases, to be fair to him. Anyway, I hope they make an official complaint about it, and not just make suggestive noises in press conferences. If they make an official complaint, only then will we know if the umpires were right or if they had made a mistake."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Meanwhile, Pakistan get the trophy and pose for the photos.

You have to give credit to them. Must congratulate Pakistan, and well done to my boys too. The matches could have gone either way. Even today a few key decisions went against us. We can't fault the effort of the players. The series could have gone our way if some key decisions had gone our way. If you bowl well, 242 was going to be a challenging total. I liked how we believed right until the end. Those key decisions at crucial times cost us. A learning process to me. A new role for me. With the talent we have, I enjoy leading the team. We can't turn things around overnight, but with the talent we have we can become a very dangerous team.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Pretty satisfying,\" says <b>Misbah-ul-Haq</b>, who is also the Man of the Match and Series. \"A win is always good, especially after the losses in South Africa series and Champions Trophy.

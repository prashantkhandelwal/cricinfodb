Avishka is out for less than 50 for the first time in the series. It's not a great ball from Joseph, who has pushed this full delivery across the batsman, and too far down leg. Avishka tries to glance this fine, but gets only a thin tickle on it, and is caught behind down the legside. The umpire thought for a moment before giving it out, and when he did, there was no complaint from Avishka."}],"fowOrder":0,"fowWicketNum":1,"fowRuns":60,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":10.2,"fowOverNumber":11,"ballOversActual":10.2,"ballOversUnique":10.02,"ballTotalRuns":60,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null},{"playerRoleType":"C","player":{"id":48988,"objectId":227772,"name":"FDM

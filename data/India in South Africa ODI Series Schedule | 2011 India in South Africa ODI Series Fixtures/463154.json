The scorecard will say edged and caught at slip, but this was not an outside edge in the true sense of the word. It was short, fractionally outside off and Dhoni went for the cut. He was a little late on the shot, and it wasn't wide enough for the cut. Plus it bounced more than he anticipated. Hence the edge, it was dying on first slip who took it well.

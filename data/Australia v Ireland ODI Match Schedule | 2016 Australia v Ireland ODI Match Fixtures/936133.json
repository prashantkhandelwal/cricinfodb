The wicket was a little bit up and down and when we lost our way in the middle of the innings it meant that we weren't going to be able to come back from that against good sides. We feel that we have done a lot of good things in today's game, we need to be kicking on from 20s, 30s and 40s. That shows where we need to go on from now.

No excuses, we gave too many freebies at the start and we need to work on this before we face South Africa. They wont let us back into the game as easily as Ireland did. We need to continue to improve at the front and take wickets in the middle, just like we did today. I'm happy at the way that Zampa bowled today, he started off nicely and hopefully can continue this. It's an international game today and to win by nine wickets, I'm very happy with that. It's always great playing over here in South Africa and it should be a quality series against them.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Usman Khawaja, Man of the Match</b>: \"Yeah it was really good to get out there. great to have a win and it was pretty comfortable in the end.The surface was a little slow, still good though and the outfield is fast.

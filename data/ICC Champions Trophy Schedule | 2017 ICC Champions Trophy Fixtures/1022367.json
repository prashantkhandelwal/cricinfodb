Well, it begins with a quicker delivery that doesn't turn. And because of that du Plessis making room to cut gets an outside edge to short third man. He sets off, then hesitates, then sets off again, and du Plessis going a second time gives Miller the go ahead to run as hard as he needs to. Only problem is by that time du Plessis again changes his mind and dives back into his batting crease, before Miller makes it.

Well, it begins with a quicker delivery that doesn't turn. And because of that du Plessis making room to cut gets an outside edge to short third man. He sets off, then hesitates, then sets off again, and du Plessis going a second time gives Miller the go ahead to run as hard as he needs to. Only problem is by that time du Plessis again changes his mind and dives back into his batting crease, before Miller makes it.

Well, it begins with a quicker delivery that doesn't turn. And because of that du Plessis making room to cut gets an outside edge to short third man. He sets off, then hesitates, then sets off again, and du Plessis going a second time gives Miller the go ahead to run as hard as he needs to. Only problem is by that time du Plessis again changes his mind and dives back into his batting crease, before Miller makes it.

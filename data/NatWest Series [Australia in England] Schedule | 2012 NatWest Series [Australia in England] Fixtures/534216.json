A whiff of controversy will cling to Morgan's successful review - Hot Spot wasn't <i>conclusive</i>, so the decision shouldn't have been overturned, even though he seemed confident he'd hit the ball - but Bell and Bopara were excellent and England should have got there even without their lucky No. 5. <b>Ravi Bopara was named Man of the Match</b> and his run-a-ball knock was just the sort of composed-but-lively innings Australia couldn't muster.

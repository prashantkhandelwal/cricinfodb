I knew I was going to get balls to score off in my areas at some stage, and I was just trying to take risks at the right time. I think when the left arm spinner came back on, I think there was only three overs left, I think that was a good opportunity to try and get the run rate down under six, and then try and do it in the next over without letting it get to the last over. Because all sorts of chaos could happen in the last. [The reverse sweep] is something I've practiced. It's not a fluke.

The rain delay had made Australia's task a little steeper, but they never let the runrate get out of hand. It was first Smith and Finch and then Smith and Labuschagne. And then when Smith fell, Stoinis took on the responsibility along with Carey. Maxwell then joined the fray and he and Carey looked to have things under control, until Hasaranga struck on his way to figures of 4 for 58. Maxwell though was still around, didn't panic, and in the end saw the game through. Sri Lanka though can be proud of their performance; the 300 they put up required Australia to complete their highest ever chase in Sri Lanka. That innings was set up by a solid opening stand, a great anchor innings from Kusal Mendis who scored and 87-ball 86, and then a blistering flourish from that man Hasaranga again at the death.

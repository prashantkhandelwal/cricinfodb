We came here, wanted to achieve something as a group in white-ball, and we did. Moving forward there are things we need to improve but pleased with the effort. We were here last time and we were beaten I remember. It is not easy place to come and win games but the way we played entire white-ball leg was fantastic. Wanted to do it for a long period of time, to achieve it was brilliant. (Today's game) It was a good pitch, but we knew it won't be easy if we lost wickets early. It happened, but the positive is that these guys haven't batted a long period in the middle overs and we got to see that from Rishabh and Hardik. Both of them were clinical - at no point did we feel they were panicking. They played great cricketing shots. (Chahal) He is a critical member, has so much experience, bowling in all sorts of formats. It was unfortunate that he missed the last T20 World Cup, but I'm pleased with how he has returned. Hardik as well, used the dimension well while bowling. One side was long and used the bouncers well. (Batting issues for top order?) Not really. But we do understand that it is something we need to look into. We played some not-so-good shots and that's what cost us wickets. But I still back those guys to come out good because they've done it for a long time. I've got nothing more to say since I understand the quality they bring to the team. (T20 World Cup and ODI World Cup - depth in squad?) we've got some solid guys in the bench who are looking for a long time to get a game.

We created chances but two guys took the game away from us, that's where we lost the game. Not concerned about batting. All summer, in T20s and ODIs we haven't batted our best. We just need to bat longer. (Topley) He's been brilliant. Got his opportunity, and delighted for him to do well. (Why only 7 overs for Topley) We were trying to search for ways to get wickets. It's been a tough schedule too. Reece is probably creaking a bit as well, so we need to manage our players. (Pant) When you give players a chance (missed stumping) they will hurt you. Hardik too, a half chance. The score we put up, we were going to need to take all our chances. (Being a keeper captain) I've found it fine to be honest. Missed a chance today but don't think its nothing to do with my captaincy. (Adil Rashid returning for SA series) We move on quickly.

Was an ideal chance for us to step up and show what we have. (Keeping England to 259) It was important for me to come in and stop the runs and bowl as many dots. We took two wickets early but they recovered well and were cruising. I love short balls. I don't fancy people taking me on, it always gets me into the game. I don't mind getting hit for six sixes as long as I take wickets. (Livingstone) We are good pals but at the end of the day that's his game. He takes his chances on. (Pant) We know his talent.

A 133-run partnership in just 115 balls between Pant (125*) and Hardik (55-ball 71) and Jadeja got the best seat in the house for a rampaging finish after that.

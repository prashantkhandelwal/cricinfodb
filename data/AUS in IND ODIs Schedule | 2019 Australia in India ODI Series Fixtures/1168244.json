At one stage, we thought we would be chasing 350, but we pulled it back after Maxi's run out. We were optimistic, we were told there'll be dew at 7:30pm, but there's (laughs) been none of that! So I got that wrong, I guess. The wicket wasn't improving, so you had to make the most of whatever loose ball you got. Tried to do that for a decent time, but you have to take the odd risk, and with every wicket lost it gets more and more difficult. With three-down we had more chances, but at five-down, it was difficult. I got out, Vijay got out, and then there was no looking back. No team wants to loose early wickets, and we take pride in our cricket. We have strung partnerships after losing two wickets, but losing three in a bunch didn't happen. The guys who have got out, will try to make the most of the next opportunity. In terms of hitting the balls well, it was one of my finest innings, and even when we were three-down, I thought I had to play my game, the style that has gotten me to this level. But, I was disappointed getting out when the difference between balls and runs were only 20. We will have a few changes in the next couple of games, but the idea is to tell the boys to put in match-winning performances, and the boys will be looking to be in top form before the flight to England.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<B>Usman Khawaja, the Man of the Match:</b> \"There's nothing like winning, especially against a really good Indian side. But with Virat batting well, you can never count your chickens, but it was nice to get the win.

To get over 300 on this wicket was a good performance. And to take three big wickets early was important. We know how hard it is for new batsmen to try and score quickly, so it was important for Usman and I to keep going. Allowed Maxi and Stoinis to bat freely at the back end. Personally, I've been training really hard, and I had faith that I'd get some runs. And it was nice to start us off with a nice opening partnership. Usman played a fantastic knock, Zamps bowled well, and Jhye Richardson was great. He put the pressure in the first 10 overs.

When he hit me for two consecutive fours, I was a bit of pressure, and if he had hit me for a couple more then the momentum would've swung towards India, so I tried to keep my cool.

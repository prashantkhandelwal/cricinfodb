KL is such a talent when you watch him from the opposite end. Running between the wickets wasn't upto the mark between both of us, but we'll get used to it soon. We can take a lot of confidence from how we created that partnership.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b> Virat Kohli, the India captain: </b> \"What's been good is in the last three games, including the one at Wankhede and first two ODIs, we've batted well in the first half. Batting second isn't an issue, we're one of the top sides, if not the best, while chasing. It's always good to get 40-50 extra. Rohit and KL were outstanding, the opening partnership set it up. Shreyas and Rishabh, the way they played, was outstanding. The more we get confident in T20s while batting first, the better. There's no major 50-over cricket now, so we need to just play fearlessly, which is the need of the hour. As a captain, nice to see the way we've batted first after losing the toss. It shows we're not reliant on the toss, we want to bat oppositions out of the game. We need to field better, we can't afford to drop catches like we have. Fielding is about wanting the ball, as long as we enjoy ourselves, we'll be right up there on the field as well.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b> Kieron Pollard, the West Indies captain: </b> \"I thought we gave it away in the last 20 overs with the ball, didn't execute well.

Maybe 40-50 runs less, it would've been much different. Credit to them, Rohit and KL batted well, it allowed the guys lower down the order come and score freely. Pooran and Hetmyer - talented youngsters who I've spoken about earlier. Hope too has shown consistency in the way he goes about his game.

I was struggling for four-five months, but now I'm  bowling well, with the perfect pace and with the right variations, so it's very satisfying for me. There wasn't much dew today, we knew they'll come hard at us, so I was just trying to mix my pace up with the variations. It was gripping, so I was looking to turn the ball and vary my pace.

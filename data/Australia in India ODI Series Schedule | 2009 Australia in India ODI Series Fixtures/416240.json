Hauritz with the deadly throw and PK is run out. It was referred to third umpire,.  It was driven hard to left of long-off and they go for the second run. Hauritz fires it to the striker's end where PK is scampering hard. He reaches out with his bat and tries to slide it in. Perhaps, he should have tried to dive in. The ball rushes past him, reaches Manou who breaks the stumps with the bat just outside the line! Australianism prevails.  They refused to fade away, refused to give an inch and India, despite a great knock from Sachin, fall short. Just like that last dismissal. What a game.

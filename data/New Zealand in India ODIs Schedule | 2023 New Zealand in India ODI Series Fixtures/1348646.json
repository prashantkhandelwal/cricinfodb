I wanted to unleash but sometimes you don't get to do it with wickets falling. I got to do it in the end. When the bowler is on top, you have to get them under pressure otherwise it's easier for them to create dot balls. I tried to get singles and boundaries and get them under pressure. I wasn't thinking about 200 before I hit those sixes in the 46th or 47th over. That's when I thought I could get a double. I won't call it a \"wow\" feeling but it feels nice when the ball goes off the bat how you want it. There's certainly a feeling of satisfaction. It has sunk in pretty well, this is certainly one of those things, like what dreams are made of."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Rohit</b>: To be honest, the way Bracewell was batting, we knew it was going to be a challenge. It was such clean striking. After we had them five down, we knew we were in the game unless we slip up. And that's what happened. But we always knew the threat of bowling under lights and with the dew like I said at the toss, which is the kind of challenge we wanted. Watching Gill bat is fanastic, clean striking and no aerial shots. We wanted to give him a run before the SL series the kind of form he was in. He's such a free-flowing batsman. Siraj has been brilliant, of late even in the other two formats. He's gone from strength to strength, running hard and clear about what he wants to do. He's not afraid to use the short ball as well which is exciting."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Latham</b>: Bracewell's was an amazing innings. The situation of the game and then play an innings like that, needing 12 off four, to put is in that situation was outstanding. Disappointing to not get across the line. Right up there, chasing a big score, tema under pressure and it was outstanding. We've seen it from him before - believe it or not. Hopefully we can take confidence from that for the next game. I think the ball gripped a bit more, we saw them use the cutters more. But the partnership between Bracewell and Santner was great."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>9.50pm</b> What a game this has turned out to be after a stunning counter-attacking innings from Michael Bracewell. All the India players are now congratulating him for this memorable knock. He scored nearly two runs a ball and in what situation - New Zealand were 131 for 6 and needed over 11 an over with over 20 overs to go and with Santner at the other end. He chaperoned the century stand and took the bowlers apart one by one who lost their lines and lengths one after the other. He pulled consistently and put a lot of not-so-poor balls also away with his clean hitting which would have scared the India bowlers after a point. He came down against the spinners and quicks fearlessly and barely failed to connect, hardly giving the bowlers any chances. It was only Siraj and Shami towards the end who kept India in the game with their experience and accuracy, before it came down to 20 off six and who else but Thakur - who had a horrible day otherwise with the ball - bowled a dipping yorker to seal it for India."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Bracewell</b>: We were just trying to give ourselves a chance, we managed to get a partnership but unfortunately it wasn't enough which is a bit of a bummer really.

Once Mitch and I got ourselves settled, we weren't talking too much about winning, we wanted to take it deep and give ourselves a chance. We wanted to have a good crack and you need to back yourselves with 20 needed off the last over. The bowlers did well in that period (after I got my hundred) with their yorkers.

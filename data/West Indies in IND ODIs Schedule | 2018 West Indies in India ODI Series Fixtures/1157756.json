You'd be forgiven for thinking so, after the drubbing in the Test series. But we've had an Indian win, a tie and, now, a West Indian win. First time ever that India have lost at home when Kohli has scored a century, and only the second time it's happened anywhere in the world. But this game was really an exposure of an old ailment in the Indian ODI team: an underexposed middle order. Rohit and Dhawan failed today, and that meant the middle order was tested. That's such a rare occurrence these days. Has been that way for a while now. And they failed, with Dhoni nicking off early, and Rayudu and Pant failing to convert starts. To make matters worse for India, they were a batsman short as they picked five bowlers in place of the allrounder Jadeja. Even so, this all seemed perfectly set up for another Indian win, with Kohli winning the toss, electing to field, and conditions expected to ease out for batting as the evening set in in Pune. All that was rendered redundant the moment the middle order was exposed. They need to find a way around this, or they could struggle against tougher tests as the World Cup approaches."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Great game for Ashley Nurse, who shored up West Indies with a late onslaught and then grabbed two wickets.

We couldn't get partnerships, which doesn't happen often. We were fine on the field. We didn't execute our plans properly. West Indies is an explosive side, capable of beating anyone on their day, and they deserved to win. When Hardik and Kedar both play, we get the extra bowling option. Kedar will come in next game which will give us better balance. We have to leave out one bowler, but we have six options to choose from. I don't want to talk about my batting.

The moment the ball hits the top edge, he starts racing towards the backward square leg boundary, tracking it over his shoulder and even putting in a full-length dive. Is that a statement to the selectors? He doesn't really dive nowaways but a day after he's dropped from the T20 team, he pulls out all the stops. Looks 10 years younger as he hunts the ball down and gets India their first wicket. Top bouncer from Bumrah too, climbing up towards Hemraj's throat, giving him no room. He looks like a batsman who doesn't trust his defence and so will always go for the riskier option to get out of trouble.

The moment the ball hits the top edge, he starts racing towards the backward square leg boundary, tracking it over his shoulder and even putting in a full-length dive.

Looks 10 years younger as he hunts the ball down and gets India their first wicket. Top bouncer from Bumrah too, climbing up towards Hemraj's throat, giving him no room. He looks like a batsman who doesn't trust his defence and so will always go for the riskier option to get out of trouble.

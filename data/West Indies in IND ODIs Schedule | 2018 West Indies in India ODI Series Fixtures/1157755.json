Full house. Credit to the West Indies as well. They showed great heart and fight. Specially in the second innings, after they were three down, Hetmyer and Hope stuck it out. Pretty proud of my innings and my milestone [10,000 runs]. It's something that we decided pre-game. Everyone was of the opinion we wanted to bat first because it was hot and humid and also in the big games, in world cups, you might have to put runs on the board and defend. The pitch was drastically different in the second innings. We were looking at 275-280 only, but I got going and we got those extra runs. We had a challenge in front of us today and luckily we got away with a tie and we'll take that at the end of the day. When the run-rate fell under six, I thought they were in a strong position but Kuldeep got a wicket, Chahal bowled a brilliant over and Umesh and Shami closed it out. One boundary off Umesh off the shoe and one in the end, a couple of inches from Rayudu from pulling it in. That's how the game goes. We should all just enjoy it and not keep pulling at strings. I've enjoyed being a part of it and West Indies certainly deserved a draw for the way they played. Rayudu was really professional. He's someone we're looking at to be a permanent No. 4. He plays spin well, he plays pace wlel, he's in good momentum, in good form. And Shai obviously, I've watched him since that Headingley game. He plays classy knocks and even Hetmyer as well. Both of them played really really well\"<br><br>"},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Really good game of cricket. Two outstanding knocks. Virat was outstanding, congrats to him for 10,000 runs.

And the wicket of Hetmyer as well, he was the set batsman, they were getting runs easy. We said at the beginning of the innings that one of our top four had to go on and bat till the end. Good on Shai to do that. India got a par score. Before coming here, we knew we should be hitting that mark over and over. I thought our bowlers tried. But we were a bit sloppy in the field.

Powell's good on the pull and he is forced to play that shot - Shami adjusting to the batsman stepping out of his crease and cramping the left-hander for room. Should Powell have gone through with an aggressive shot? The new ball is the best chance to score runs on this slow pitch so perhaps he can be given a little leeway. But at this level, and so early in the innings, you shouldn't be picking the deep fielders out.

Unfortunately we fell short by 20 runs, we gave away some runs on the field. The Indians have a very good batting line-up.

The last 10 overs we had to get a fair amount of runs, we knew it will get a bit easy to bat on in the second half. Most of the Sri Lankan fields are quite big, if it's not needed it is advisable to not go for the big shots. This outfield was quick and we could use the pace of the bowler. If one of me and Irfan got out, we may not have got to that score. So we played safe for a while. We still need to improve, not only in the bowling but also the batting. The guy who was set usually carried it forward but it's important that we dictate the bowling and score 15 runs more than the par score. If we are playing with part-time bowlers, we need to those 10 to 15 runs. The [limping] is not a major concern, it's not a big injury.

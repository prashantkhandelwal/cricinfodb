The ball grazes the inside edge, then the thigh pad, and pops up to Maxwell. Williamson is Stonis' maiden one-day international victim. How about that for a start?

He collects the ball, falls in front of the stumps, and under-arms it into the stumps to catch Hazlewood short. Hazlewood had lost his head.

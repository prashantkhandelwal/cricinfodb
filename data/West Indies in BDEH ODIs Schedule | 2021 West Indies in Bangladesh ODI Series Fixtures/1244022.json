There was a brief resistance from Mayers and Powell, but once Powell fell to debutant Hasan Mahmud, West Indies didn't take long to dissipate again for 122. In the resonse, you have to say now in hindsight, that Tamim iqbal and Liton Das did well to set a decent foundation, because once Akeal Hosein came on to bowl, the runs just dried up. Hosein finishes with 3 for 26 on debut, and Jason Mohammed also bowled well to take the wicket of Tamim Iqbal. Alzarri Joseph enjoyed a lead role with the new ball, and bowled eight outstanding overs on the trot. Perhaps West Indies will want to reinforce their spin reserves for the next game?

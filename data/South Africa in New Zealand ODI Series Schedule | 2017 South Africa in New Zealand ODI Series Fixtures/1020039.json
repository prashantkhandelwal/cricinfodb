Not only do South Africa leave Eden Park with fonder memories, they leave it with the No. 1 ranking in their possession too. It was a somewhat antithetical, one-sided finish to an otherwise well-fought series. Plenty to still look forward to as the teams switch to whites with the first Test beginning on Wednesday.

It is not often that a series goes to 2-2, credit to New Zealand for making this a tough series. Great effort overall. I don't think it was quick as it is normally here. It was quite slow and moved around a bit. They came back well, they are always a team that squeezes really well. They put the pressure back on us and it is always easy to go into a negative mindset in such a situation. But fantastic knocks from both Faf and David Miller. I'll be up watching the Test series in the morning. I'll miss the guys, but I look forward to spending some time with family before I go back to playing more cricket."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Kane Williamson</b> - Credit to AB and the Proteas for outplaying us in the match.

They bowled pretty well, they deserve everything they achieved tonight, but from our perspective, we will look to improve and come back hard. We need to put in those complete performances and show the signs of improvement. This summer at home, particularly, we have played a number of series against some of the top oppositions in the world and it has shown us where we need to improve.

Carey and Green soaked a lot of pressure at the start and it was brilliant, it would have been better had they taken it till the end but credit to New Zealand for coming back. Our start wasn't ideal against Boult. There's still a bit to work on. Green will be sore and tired, he was cramping in his legs first, then arms as well. It's just his 11th game."},{"type":"HTML","html":"That's all we have today from this cracking ODI series opener in Cairns. Australia take a 1-0 lead and 10 points for the Super League.

Previous highest was 231 by <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/canada-tour-of-kenya-and-namibia-2007-08-296682/kenya-vs-canada-1st-odi-296685/full-scorecard\">Kenya vs Canada in 2007</a>."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>10.13pm</b> An entertaining night in Cairns comes to an end, and what a way to return to the city for International cricket after eight years. There was plenty of action right from the first over - a review followed by a stunning catch from Maxwell, some tight bowling from Australia which ended with Maxwell taking four and Hazlewood three. And who would have thought 233 would be so difficult to chase in an ODI. Boult's swing, Henry's pace and seam movement reduced Australia to 44 for 5. But when it looked like New Zealand would take the game away with one or two more wickets, Carey and Green put on a fighting century stand and brought right Australia back. Australia lost wickets again, Green was down with cramps but he took them across the line eventually. New Zealand played some poor cricket in the end in my view. Early on as well, they should have given Boult another over - a sixth - in his first spell when he was red hot with the ball, and it's the new ball that he's best with. Later on too, they bowled slightly wide to Zampa and gave easy singles when Australia needed Green back on strike. A dramatic finish - with a sprinkle of rain - went Australia's way eventually."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":41162060,"id":41162060,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":44.06,"oversActual":44.6,"overNumber":45,"ballNumber":6,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":1,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":211,"wagonY":315,"wagonZone":4,"timestamp":"2022-09-06T12:11:57.000Z","modified":"2022-09-06T12:12:02.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":58435,"bowlerPlayerId":64864,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":232,"totalInningWickets":8,"predictions":null,"title":"Santner

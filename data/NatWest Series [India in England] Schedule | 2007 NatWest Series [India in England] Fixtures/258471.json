Maiden centuries from Alastair Cook and Ian Bell set it up as England made 288, then James Anderson did the early damage with the new ball. Andrew Flintoff bowled well on his comeback, seven rapid and hostile overs, while Dimitri Mascarenhas finally picked up his first ODI wicket. For India it was a tough day. The fielding was poor and the batting didn't fire under lights. But there are six games left so plenty of time claw things back. The next outing is at Bristol, on Friday, and it's another day/night match.

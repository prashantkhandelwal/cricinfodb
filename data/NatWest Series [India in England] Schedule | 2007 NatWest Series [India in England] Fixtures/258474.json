It was refered upstairs and verdict was out."}],"fowOrder":6,"fowWicketNum":7,"fowRuns":114,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":23.5,"fowOverNumber":24,"ballOversActual":23.5,"ballOversUnique":23.05,"ballTotalRuns":114,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null}],"inningFallOfWickets":[{"fowOrder":0,"fowWicketNum":1,"fowRuns":0,"fowOvers":0.5,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":1,"fowWicketNum":2,"fowRuns":14,"fowOvers":3.1,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":2,"fowWicketNum":3,"fowRuns":35,"fowOvers":5.5,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":3,"fowWicketNum":4,"fowRuns":81,"fowOvers":14.4,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":4,"fowWicketNum":5,"fowRuns":95,"fowOvers":16.3,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":5,"fowWicketNum":6,"fowRuns":110,"fowOvers":21.2,"fowBalls":null},{"fowOrder":6,"fowWicketNum":7,"fowRuns":114,"fowOvers":23.5,"fowBalls":null}],"inningDRSReviews":[]}]},"smartScorecard":null,"bestPerformance":{"batsmen":[{"_uid":7716,"player":{"id":7716,"objectId":36084,"name":"Yuvraj

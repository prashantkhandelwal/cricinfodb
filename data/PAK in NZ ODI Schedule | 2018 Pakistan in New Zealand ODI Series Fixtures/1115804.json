Amazing reflexes, he takes some absolute stunners in practice, this ain't practice."}],"fowOrder":7,"fowWicketNum":8,"fowRuns":32,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":18.1,"fowOverNumber":19,"ballOversActual":18.1,"ballOversUnique":18.01,"ballTotalRuns":32,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null},{"playerRoleType":"P","player":{"id":51498,"objectId":290948,"name":"Mohammad Amir","longName":"Mohammad Amir","mobileName":"Amir","indexName":"Mohammad Amir","battingName":"Mohammad Amir","fieldingName":"Mohammad Amir","slug":"mohammad-amir","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302800/302820.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1992,"month":4,"date":13},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["lhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lfm"],"longBattingStyles":["left-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":302820,"objectId":1221173,"slug":"mohammad-amir-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302800/302820.jpg","width":160,"height":201,"caption":"Mohammad Amir portrait","longCaption":"Mohammad Amir portrait, April 2020","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":7,"playerRoleTypeIds":[4],"playingRoles":["bowler"],"headshotImage":{"id":320457,"objectId":1261295,"slug":"mohammad-amir-player-page-headshot-cutout-2021","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320457.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"Mohammad Amir player page headshot cutout, 2021","longCaption":"Mohammad Amir player page headshot cutout, 2021","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320457.square.png"}}},"battedType":"yes","runs":14,"balls":24,"minutes":20,"fours":3,"sixes":0,"strikerate":58.33,"isOut":true,"dismissalType":2,"dismissalBatsman":{"id":51498,"objectId":290948,"name":"Mohammad Amir","longName":"Mohammad Amir","mobileName":"Amir","indexName":"Mohammad Amir","battingName":"Mohammad Amir","fieldingName":"Mohammad Amir","slug":"mohammad-amir","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302800/302820.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1992,"month":4,"date":13},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["lhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lfm"],"longBattingStyles":["left-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":302820,"objectId":1221173,"slug":"mohammad-amir-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302800/302820.jpg","width":160,"height":201,"caption":"Mohammad Amir portrait","longCaption":"Mohammad Amir portrait, April 2020","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":7,"playerRoleTypeIds":[4],"playingRoles":["bowler"],"headshotImage":{"id":320457,"objectId":1261295,"slug":"mohammad-amir-player-page-headshot-cutout-2021","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320457.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"Mohammad Amir player page headshot cutout, 2021","longCaption":"Mohammad Amir player page headshot cutout, 2021","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320457.square.png"}}},"dismissalBowler":{"id":51092,"objectId":277912,"name":"TA Boult","longName":"Trent Boult","mobileName":"Boult","indexName":"Boult, TA","battingName":"TA Boult","fieldingName":"Boult","slug":"trent-boult","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303673.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1989,"month":7,"date":22},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["rhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lfm"],"longBattingStyles":["right-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":303673,"objectId":1222471,"slug":"trent-boult-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303673.jpg","width":160,"height":200,"caption":"Trent Boult portrait","longCaption":"Trent Boult, Brisbane, November 4, 2015","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":5,"playerRoleTypeIds":[4],"playingRoles":["bowler"],"headshotImage":{"id":316619,"objectId":1251251,"slug":"ta-boult-headshot","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316619.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"TA Boult headshot","longCaption":"TA Boult headshot","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":null}}},"dismissalFielders":[{"player":null,"isKeeper":0,"isSubstitute":0}],"dismissalText":{"short":"bowled","long":" b Boult","commentary":"Mohammad Amir b Boult 14 (24b 3x4 0x6 20m) SR: 58.33"},"dismissalComment":[{"type":"HTML","html":"140 kph, four and out!

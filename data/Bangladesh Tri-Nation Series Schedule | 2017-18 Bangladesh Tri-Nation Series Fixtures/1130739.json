Umpire Rahman shakes his head and shoots down the caught-behind appeal. The keeper had also whipped the bails off but think the appeal is for the catch behind the wicket. <b>Dickwella insists a review</b>. Dananjaya dangles it up around off and gets it to break away in the corridor. Tamim wafts away from the body with no feet. Has he nicked this? Ultra Edge detects a spike, and Tamim has to exit. Dickwella was so confident that he did not bother consulting with his captain Chandimal for a review. He himself called for it. Umpire Rahman's on-field not-out call has been reversed. Dananjaya and Dickwella are pumped. Sri Lanka needed this opening. No hundred for Tamim, and the Mirpur crowd has been hushed into silence"}],"fowOrder":1,"fowWicketNum":2,"fowRuns":170,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":29.1,"fowOverNumber":30,"ballOversActual":29.1,"ballOversUnique":29.01,"ballTotalRuns":170,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null},{"playerRoleType":"P","player":{"id":48277,"objectId":56143,"name":"Shakib

He couldn't find the gap, he couldn't hit over the top, he was peppered by a volley of bouncers and even copped a jarring blow on the helmet. His hamstring probably wan't in great shape either. Mendis now dares to step down the track and launch it over the bowler's head. Mashrafe smartly pulls his length back and a drop in pace also foxes Mendis and he eventually simply chips it in the air to mid-off. Nineteen runs off 34 balls at a strike-rate of 56 in a 321 chase?

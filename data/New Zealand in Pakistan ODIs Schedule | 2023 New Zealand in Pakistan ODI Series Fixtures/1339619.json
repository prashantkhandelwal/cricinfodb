Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman forged a crucial partnership that set the platform for Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Pakistan did make it difficult for themselves by slowing down in the middle overs and even without some of the mainstays, New Zealand did pretty well and should give themselves a pat on the back for their bowling performance as they created some panic towards the end and took the game deep. The pitch had been baking under the sun and was pretty docile. There was barely any swing for the bowlers but spinners got some assistance. Pakistan have got a few ODIs before the showpiece event to address the outstanding issues; the chase got derailed when Babar Azam nicked one through to the keeper and the floodgates were opened. Shan Masood played a confusing knock and struggled to get going which raises questions on his role in the team. In the end, Mohammad Rizwan made sure they don't make a mess of the game and some timely blows took all hope away from the Tom Latham-led side."},{"type":"HTML","html":"sam: \"I think I can breathe without choking on incoming breaths now?

Ireland had their chance to get a series win against a team ranked in the top eight for the first time in history, but fell short today to Malan and De Kock. Still, they have been very, very good this series. South Africa knew they had to bring their best today, and a 225-run opening stand was quite a step in that direction. But you look at the final score, and how easy run-scoring got, and you can safely say that this match was buried when they decided to toss the new ball to Keshav Maharaj. He took out Stirling and Balbirnie early on, and it is not generally easy going for Ireland when one of those two don't get deep into the innings. Having said that, they will be very pleased with how Tector, Campher and Simi went today. 276 in a chase of 347 after being 92 for 6 is nothing to chuckle at. Lovely end to an evenly fought series.

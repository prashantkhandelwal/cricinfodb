Bangladesh were distinctly average with the bat, and New Zealand were favourites at the halfway stage. But whatever Bangladesh could do badly New Zealand could do worse with an astonishing top-order collapse that saw the top five score a combined grand total of 12 runs between them. At 20 for 5 it appeared all over, but Vettori and Elliott dragged them out of the quagmire and even briefly into a relatively comfortable position. But then New Zealand consistently lost wickets after appearing to have the situation under control, until Mills was left with 30 to get with only Bennett for company. Mills threatened to pull off the heist with some clean striking but fell agonisingly short as Bangladesh made history for the second time in 3 days"},{"type":"HTML","html":"But full credit must go to a side that was expected by all and sundry to be on the end of a 5-0 thrashing at the beginning of the series, only to completely turn the tables on those predictions and end up comprehensively demolishing their opposition by the resounding scoreline of 4-0. Often capable of putting together a decent performance, the Bangladeshis finally stitched them all together into one series rather than showing the occasional flash of brilliance. They consistently and convincingly outplayed their opposition in every department of the game, and won all the key moments."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Meanwhile the New Zealanders can do little but look back on this series as an astoundingly awful set of performances.

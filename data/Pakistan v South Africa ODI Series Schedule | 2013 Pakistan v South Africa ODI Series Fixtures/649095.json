The target was gettable as boundaries were coming freely with the new ball, it was a matter of playing 50 overs. The ball was coming nicely on the bat.

He brings in intensity to the team and he ups the pace of the game. Lopsy's second spell was unbelievable and Tahir's breakthroughs were really crucial and Dale brings this intensity which is irreplaceable.

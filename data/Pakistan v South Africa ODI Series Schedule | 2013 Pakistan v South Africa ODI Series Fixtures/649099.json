AB de Villiers showed what a class act he was on a pitch that was not cooperative. Maqsood showed glimmers of what a tantalising prospect he can be for the team, especially as they come to grips with the dearth in their batting. As Misbah said poignantly, it is an old story, and it will be interesting to see how the Pakistanis respond to the situation, the answers of which we will see in nine days time. For now, this is Rohan Sharma, on behalf of scorer Binoy George, thanking you for your time and company. Cheers!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>AB de Villiers, South Africa captain</b>: It is extremely satisfying. Wonderful series from the boys. We really gelled together as a team and played together as one. We put our personal differences aside and pulled for the team. Makes me a very proud captain. I found the track very difficult and the spinners bowled really well. Afridi bowled a good spell to me. Felt like I was going nowhere. Don't know what happened in the last 10-15 overs, but it shows that if you hang in there in international sport, you can get through a bad patch. So really enjoyed it at the end. We are still away from home so it makes it a very special series win for us. We didn't start well in the first two games, and we could have gone down 2-0, but with a lot of team spirit and fight we won the first ODI, and everything was in a good place. Great to have the depth we have at the moment. We wanted to get Vernon involved for the last while and he showed what a special player he is. Also Parnell and Robby did well and all the energy from the team was really great. Proud of each and every member of the team. Having clinched the series already, it is always difficult to get going on but when you wear this shirt (SA) and are playing at this level, then you have to play your best with the same intensity. The boys did exactly that so really proud of that. First series win for Russell Domingo away from home so he will have a few beers I am sure. He has all the makings to make a great coach one day, and he is going in that direction. I am enjoying the captaincy I am in a very good space at the moment. Tomorrow we will take it easy and there is a golf tournament here so we will take that in. Then back to the T20 series (in South Africa)."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Man of the Series award</b>: Ryan McLaren (South Africa) - It's been a good run for me personally in the last couple of months. I was given good backing by the management and happy with the opportunities I have got, but there is a lot of teamwork that goes behind it. There are two guys who helped me. Gary Kirsten has been a massive influence on my career and Allan Donald, on the bowling side, has really made a big difference. It's great having an award like this but I think there's a lot of work that needs to be done. It's a case of trying to adopt a positive mindset and take as many wickets as possible. If you are going to be defensive as a bowler you will be found out. So tried to adopt a positive and attacking mindset as a bowler. After the Sri Lanka series, it was a tough series for the team. So it was a real learning curve for us. Learned a couple of lessons here and tried to be adaptable. Working towards WC 2014 so this is all part of the process, so keep trying to learn from each series. It's great to have the depth we have in the bowling front. To work around guys like Steyn and Morkel, who have been stalwarts is a pleasure."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Man of the Match award</b>: AB de Villiers (South Africa)"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan captain</b>: They played really well.

Our bowling was really doing well in the way Irfan, Junaid bowled. Spinners bowled well. Shehzad batted well so that was a positive. That's a big worry for us (the upcoming SA tour).

Parnell was the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 36, and most of the other bowlers picked up at least a wicket.

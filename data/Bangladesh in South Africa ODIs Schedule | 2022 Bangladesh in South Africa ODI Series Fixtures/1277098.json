He grabs the ball, but realising that he is falling over to the other side of rope, he throws it back with his right hand. He goes outside the boundary line then comes back in again, but keeps his eyes on the ball throughout. And once he is back in, it becomes a simple catch. It was a full ball on middle and off, and de Kock went down on his back knee to slog-sweep.

Fortunately, the bowlers upfront did a good job and we were not put under pressure. The new ball could've been tough but Quinny (de Kock) saw it differently. These conditions are different from Centurion, which is a lot truer. We will take forward the confidence and momemtum from this game into the final game"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Rabada</b> is the <b>Player of the match</b>: After the first wicket where it hit a crack and reared up we felt we were in. In the recent past, Wanderers has given extra bounce with the new ball and not much thereafter but there was variable bounce today. With the ball gripping, our seamers did well to utilize it. You try to keep it as simple as possible. We can't just go all out aggressive and it's important to rely on your tactics. To rely on them and execute it is what we see as aggression and not bowling short"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Tamim Iqbal</b>: the wicket was not what we expected. Pace and bounce we can take it, but uneven you can't. We can make a lot of comments about winning toss and bat/bowl. I think we can't write off this game. We made mistakes and they bowled well. In the middle overs, we could've scored more and hurt them. At one stage, 100 was looking difficult but we made 194. At the end of the day, we can blame a lot of things but we played poorly. Sometimes things don't go your way."},{"type":"HTML","html":"In hindsight, Bangladesh would've been better off bowling rather than batting after winning the toss.

South Africa bowlers were happy to exploit the bounce aided by the pitch and they had the top order of Bangladesh in all sorts of trouble.

deep midwicket!</strong> Afif with a repeat of the catch Tamim took in the first ODI. What else can Afif do for his side today? Right on the edge of the rope, he has to leap a little to his left, and he times his jump perfectly. He grabs the ball, but realising that he is falling over to the other side of rope, he throws it back with his right hand. He goes outside the boundary line then comes back in again, but keeps his eyes on the ball throughout. And once he is back in, it becomes a simple catch. It was a full ball on middle and off, and de Kock went down on his back knee to slog-sweep. It was timed well and also made a sweet sound off the bat, but for Afif's

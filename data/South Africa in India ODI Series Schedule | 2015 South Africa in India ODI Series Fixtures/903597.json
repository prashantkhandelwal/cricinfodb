AB de Villiers does a Fourie du Preez, great leadership. A thoroughly dominant bowling performance in those last 20 overs. India were favourites for most of that chase and played really well to get into that position but were squeezed like a wet rag in those last few overs. They employed a terrific gameplan of going short and full on middle and leg with a 4-5 field and that did not look like it was working but they soon got those lengths perfect. Dhoni and Kohli were in control of that chase but this plan threw them off their game, as they were stalled. The middle order struggled to find any momentum after both of them fell and Morne Morkel was superb. Three consecutive games won by matches lost in the chase, all of which should have been won by the batting side but well, the quality of bowling has been different from a few months ago."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Two sterling performances in today's game with both bat and ball for SA."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Morne Morkel is the Man of the Match</b>: Really worked hard this week on mixing it up a bit.

And we are looking to give chances as well so it's a tricky one. Jinx batted well at 3 but Virat couldn't score, this is something we will have to look at. I thought our bowlers did well, maybe a bit more dew would have made it difficult.

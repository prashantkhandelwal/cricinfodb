A lot of the work for that total was done by 18-year old Sachin Tendulkar, who scored a chanceless half-century, looking at ease against the pace of Wasim Akram, the discipline of Imran Khan and the spin of Mushtaq Ahmed. Plenty for the India fans to rave about in this gem of a batsman. Pakistan had one of their own in their line-up, Javed Miandad, who seemed determined to bat out the 50 overs and along the way frustrate the Indians at every chance. At one point, he even started mocking Kiran More, leaping up and down on the spot. Aamer Sohail hit a half-century and giving him excellent support as well but Srinath knocked over Miandad with a splendid yorker and the game was pretty much won right

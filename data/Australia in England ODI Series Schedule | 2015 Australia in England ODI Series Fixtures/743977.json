Shane Watson removed James Taylor and the middle couldn't get going today. Mitchell Starc was impressive in his latter spells, well supported by Nathan Coulter-Nile and Pat Cummins. England should think back and consider this as a chance that slipped away from those two strong positions. But it's a five-match series so time to hit back. They have a few questions to ask over the death bowling, but there is no need for Trevor Bayliss and Eoin Morgan to panic. A developing side will have days like this.

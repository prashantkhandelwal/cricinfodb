Wild celebrations are on now. Bravo did a victory run, and the rest of the jubilant West Indians caught up with him near the ropes and they all huddled for a victory jig. Ah! that sweet music of victory! All this while, Yuvraj Singh was hanging almost motionless at the crease, down on his knees, resting on that bat which nearly took India home but failed at the death. Meanwhile Brian Lara was celebrating with his boys. Earlier, he had shuffled his bowlers, threw himself on the field, inspiring his boys to follow his act. Lara has encashed everything that his bat can offer: runs, records, name and fame but captaincy glory has continued to elude him. Destiny has thrown him one last chance, history is calling and Lara, by accepting the top job, has made it clear that he has not gone deaf. It's going to be one long tough climb up the mountain but they have made a start here. Its really too early, to pass any verdict on his latest stint with the captaincy though.

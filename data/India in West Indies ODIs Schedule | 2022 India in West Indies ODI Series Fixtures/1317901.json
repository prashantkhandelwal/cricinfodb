But <strong>Iyer has reviewed</strong>. Could be a big moment in the match. Joseph fired in a yorker which shaped to angle in, and hit Iyer's toe bang on as he missed his flick. There is no bat involved there, as confirmed by UltraEdge. My guess is that Iyer's immediate reaction of hobbling after being hit might have convinced the umpire that there was likely no inside edge. Ah, it is umpire's call on hitting the wickets, since it is shown to be grazing the base of leg stump.

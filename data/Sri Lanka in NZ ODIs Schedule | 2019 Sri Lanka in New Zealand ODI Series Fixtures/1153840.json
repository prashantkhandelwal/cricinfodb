Two competitive sides came out and played good cricket. The effort was there in the field but the ball kept flying. Sri Lanka were outstanding and put us under pressure in 90% of the chase. Guptill is a world-class player and pushed that total above par. Neesham and Taylor took the total to an area of strength. It was a match-changing contribution from Neesham. We were staring at 330 but Neesh took us to 370. A lot of contributions from everyone.<br><br>"},{"type":"HTML","html":"That is all we have for you from this game.

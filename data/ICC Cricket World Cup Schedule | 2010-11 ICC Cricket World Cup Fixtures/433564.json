Sarwan looked to play with a straight bat, but just missed it. Was there an inside edge? It was going to hit the top of middle, so the decision is upheld. Sarwan is gone and WI are out of reviews.  He was really well forward, and if Taufel had said not out, I doubt if SA would have referred it. Tahir was ecstactic, ran around like a man possessed when it was given first up.

Amla was cut in half as he looked to force from the crease, and ended up getting an inner edge that flew low down to the leg side. The keeper Devon Thomas who has been making a lot of noise, pulled a blinder, arresting his momentum and diving low to the left. The umpire asked Amla to wait, to check if Roach over-stepped.

Sarwan looked to play with a straight bat, but just missed it. Was there an inside edge? It was going to hit the top of middle, so the decision is upheld. Sarwan is gone and WI are out of reviews.  He was really well forward, and if Taufel had said not out, I doubt if SA would have referred it. Tahir was ecstactic, ran around like a man possessed when it was given first up.

He was really well forward, and if Taufel had said not out, I doubt if SA would have referred it. Tahir was ecstactic, ran around like a man possessed when it was given first up.

Several things happened there. First up, Roach delivered a snorter of an inducker, accentuated by the fact that he delivered it from wide of the crease. It was always coming in, and then landed on a length outside off before nipping in. Amla was cut in half as he looked to force from the crease, and ended up getting an inner edge that flew low down to the leg side. The keeper Devon Thomas who has been making a lot of noise, pulled a blinder, arresting his momentum and diving low to the left. The umpire asked Amla to wait, to check if Roach over-stepped. The replays suggested it was cut and go. If I were the third ump, I'd have probably said no-ball, but it was deemed legal.

Amla was cut in half as he looked to force from the crease, and ended up getting an inner edge that flew low down to the leg side. The keeper Devon Thomas who has been making a lot of noise, pulled a blinder, arresting his momentum and diving low to the left. The umpire asked Amla to wait, to check if Roach over-stepped.

Several things happened there. First up, Roach delivered a snorter of an inducker, accentuated by the fact that he delivered it from wide of the crease. It was always coming in, and then landed on a length outside off before nipping in. Amla was cut in half as he looked to force from the crease, and ended up getting an inner edge that flew low down to the leg side. The keeper Devon Thomas who has been making a lot of noise, pulled a blinder, arresting his momentum and diving low to the left. The umpire asked Amla to wait, to check if Roach over-stepped. The replays suggested it was cut and go. If I were the third ump, I'd have probably said no-ball, but it was deemed legal.

If weather conditions do not permit, the teams will be declared joint winners.\n\n<p>\n<b>Net Run Rate</b>\n\nA team‟s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nNote: Any play during a one over per side eliminator is excluded from these calculations.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2‟s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team‟s refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team‟s innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Group

I knew that as openers we have to stay in. So once I got set, I just carried on and as I said, I was sensible and I didn't want to throw away my wicket. Once you're set, once you've played 20 overs, it gets easier. It's the job for openers, play out the new ball, and that's the opposition's strength. We don't get runs that easily in the first 15 overs but Rohit played an amazing knock again, he's very good at converting to centuries. So it's good that we both value our wickets.

Bumrah has matured as a bowler now, has played a great amount of cricket and he understands his bowling. it's very important for any player. He understands what fields he needs to set and on a wicket like that you need to be clever, keep it tight, keep up pressure. Bhuvneshwar too did exactly the same We never wanted to let them off the hook and our spinners have been magnificent throughout the tournament. They kept taking wickets and when you do that, you win. It was a challenge when Hardik got injured. We were playing four spinners including Jadhav. We wondered about going with three seamers, but knowing these conditions, we went with the spinners and they have been great. Jadeja too, to come back into the side and do so well. Opening with Dhawan is, I don't even need to speak to him, it's important to let him be and we've batted enough to understand each other's games. We know how important the first 10 overs is. The chase becomes a little easier if that's done well. The most important thing was to bat as long as possible and that's what we did. Nothing is easy [hitting sixes] and when it comes off it looks nice.

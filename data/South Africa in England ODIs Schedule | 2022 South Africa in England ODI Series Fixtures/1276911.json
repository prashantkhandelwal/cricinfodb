England's total of 201 proved to be more than enough in the end, thanks largely to two bursts of speed from Liam Livingstone and Sam Curran, whose brief flurries of big-hitting proved decisive. Dwaine Pretorius's career-best haul was trumped from the moment South Africa slumped to 6 for 4 in reply, with Reece Topley once again immense in the powerplay. With rain lurking, Buttler turned to his spinners to rush through the overs, and they responded with five wickets between them.

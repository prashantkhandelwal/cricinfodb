I thought we gave away 15-20 runs more, it is difficult to bowl to Dhoni and Raina, our fielding could have been better too. We can take many positives out of this game. The new guys did well. Suranga bowled well. I have enjoyed batting up the order. I am more relaxed, I can play my shots It is easy to bat with Dilshan and it later flows with Sanga. But as I said, I played a pretty bad shot.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"That late burst from Dhoni and Raina proved the difference in the end, turning a good score built on the twin centuries from Gambhir and Kohli into a stiff target.

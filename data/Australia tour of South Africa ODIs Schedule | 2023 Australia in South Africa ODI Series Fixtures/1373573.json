We lost a few wickets which pegged us back but thought 320 was par. We knew what was coming, so lack of experience is not the issue. It's all about learning as quick as you can. As much as the powerplay didn't go as we wanted, out bowlers plugging back is exactly what we wanted. Spinners doing well is massive. We haven't seen conditions like these where we could go with two frontline spinners. Aiden did well with the new ball as well. We look for versatility from spin and hope the quicks do well too.

Australia were crusing at 157 for 2 in the 19th over when it happened. Ten-and-a-bit overs later, they were languishing at 200 for 8. The spinners, Shamsi in particular, was instrumental.

I was disappointed to lose 5 for 20 at the end and the way we bowled was the way we had to, to have a chance. Clint's bowling was terrific but we couldn't get over the line. We've all got to improve.

Carbs has got a great head on his shoulders, he's cool and calm. I'm feeling all right, good to get another innings. [Ben Stokes] has been playing really well and he's come up trumps.

I've played a lot with Ben, it was good to be out there with him. We couldn't quite see the ball [on tight runs]. I think Johnson did me with a slower ball at the end and it just went straight up ... The ball has been going into the gloves nicely since the Champions Trophy, so great to continue.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>6.15pm:</b> It was always setting up to be nipper at the end but Buttler saw it big and served up the innings England needed, a sparkling 65 from 48 balls. It was a supremely well-paced knock, saving a mighty boosh or two for the end, when it was most needed; and it meant Clint McKay's stunning hat-trick was not the decisive act it looked like being. Carberry and Morgan steadied England with a century partnership but the 75 runs, in less than ten overs, added by Buttler and Stokes were pivotal. And, to the delight of the home support, it was Mitch Johnson who got whacked at the end. Cardiff has had some special finishes - Bairstow's debut, SL-NZ in the Champions Trophy - and this has been another to savour."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":8610467,"id":8610467,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":49.02,"oversActual":49.2,"overNumber":50,"ballNumber":2,"totalRuns":0,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":220,"wagonY":228,"wagonZone":4,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":53271,"bowlerPlayerId":10130,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":227,"totalInningWickets":7,"predictions":null,"title":"Johnson to Buttler","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Just one run needed now"}],"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"frees the arms again but can only dig this out to short midwicket"}],"commentPostTextItems":null,"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":8610465,"id":8610465,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":49.01,"oversActual":49.1,"overNumber":50,"ballNumber":1,"totalRuns":6,"batsmanRuns":6,"isFour":false,"isSix":true,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":361,"wagonY":194,"wagonZone":3,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":53271,"bowlerPlayerId":10130,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":227,"totalInningWickets":7,"predictions":null,"title":"Johnson to Buttler","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"smashed it, absolutely SMASHED!!

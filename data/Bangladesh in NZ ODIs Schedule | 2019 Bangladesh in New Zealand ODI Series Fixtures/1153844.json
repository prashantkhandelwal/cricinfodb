Nicholls using the relative non-pressure of a slender chase to get himself a half-century in what is still a new role for him. And Guptill finally getting past the teens to notch up a hundred AND finish the innings with it. Williamson's cheap dismissal possibly the only worry for New Zealand today, who also got in good game time for all players involved. Solid from the home team. Bangladesh had to deal with what a lot of subcontinental sides face when they don't get practice games ahead of overseas tours. A bit of T20 hangover too, perhaps, coming in straight from the BPL. Couldn't deal with the swinging ball, couldn't do a lot when the ball stopped swinging either.

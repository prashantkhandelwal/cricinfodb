Rovman is dragged forward to defend, but he's playing for turn that isn't there. At best the ball turned only gently, and takes his outside edge. Mushfiqur holds on, standing up to the stumps. Wait a minute, Rovman has reviewed this. Substitute Carlos Brathwaite has come on and is arguing with the umpires. The commentators on air saying it could be something to do with number of fielders inside the circle/outside it. Brathwaite is still in the middle and gesturing, standing alongside Hope and Powell. On the other side of the pitch the Bangladesh players are gathered. It ends in Brathwaite walking off, and Powell is walking back too. So he's definitely out."}],"fowOrder":4,"fowWicketNum":5,"fowRuns":99,"fowOvers":25.6,"fowBalls":null}]},{"player":{"id":24672,"objectId":56007,"name":"Mashrafe Mortaza","longName":"Mashrafe Mortaza","mobileName":"Mortaza","indexName":"Mashrafe Mortaza","battingName":"Mashrafe Mortaza","fieldingName":"Mashrafe Mortaza","slug":"mashrafe-mortaza","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302900/302999.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1983,"month":10,"date":5},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["rhb"],"bowlingStyles":["rfm"],"longBattingStyles":["right-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["right-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":302999,"objectId":1221382,"slug":"mashrafe-mortaza-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/302900/302999.jpg","width":160,"height":203,"caption":"Mashrafe Mortaza portrait","longCaption":"Mashrafe Mortaza portrait, Arpril 2020","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":25,"playerRoleTypeIds":[4],"playingRoles":["bowler"],"headshotImage":{"id":316529,"objectId":1251158,"slug":"mashrafe-mortaza-headshot","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316529.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"Mashrafe Mortaza headshot","longCaption":"Mashrafe Mortaza headshot","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":null}}},"bowledType":"yes","overs":9,"balls":54,"maidens":1,"conceded":34,"wickets":2,"economy":3.77,"runsPerBall":0.62,"dots":28,"fours":2,"sixes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null,"inningWickets":[{"dismissalBatsman":{"id":72509,"objectId":677081,"name":"KMA Paul","longName":"Keemo Paul","mobileName":"Paul","indexName":"Paul, KMA","battingName":"KMA Paul","fieldingName":"Paul","slug":"keemo-paul","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/352300/352355.4.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1998,"month":2,"date":21},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["rhb"],"bowlingStyles":["rfm"],"longBattingStyles":["right-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["right-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":352355,"objectId":1353249,"slug":"keemo-paul-player-portrait-2023","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/352300/352355.4.jpg","width":160,"height":225,"caption":"Keemo Paul, player portrait 2023","longCaption":"Keemo Paul, player portrait 2023","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","photographer":"Randy Brooks","peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":4,"playerRoleTypeIds":[5],"playingRoles":["allrounder"],"headshotImage":{"id":355400,"objectId":1361235,"slug":"keemo-paul-player-page-headshot-cutout-2023","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/355400/355400.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"Keemo Paul, player page headshot cutout 2023","longCaption":"Keemo Paul, player page headshot cutout 2023","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/355400/355400.square.png"}}},"dismissalType":2,"dismissalComment":[{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>the stumps have gone for a walk</b> keeps it full and straight, slower one nipping back in.

I thought I batted quite well in Hamilton, but I wasn't there at the end. Got a bit of cramp. It was good to have all those partnerships. You've just got to give yourself a chance, set those little goals along the way. You can't win it in the first 10 overs, but you certainly can lose it. It looked like England would get 360-380 at one stage, so our bowlers did well to keep them down. I was about a 110 or 120, physio came out and asked if I wanted to stay in or come out. I'm glad I stayed in. I couldn't run any twos, so I didn't want to put any pressure on the other guy. So I had a go, and hit a couple out of the screws. The way Nicholls batted and finished it off - you don't want to panic in that situation.

We lost 4 for 20 or 25 which we cannot afford to do. 335 was a good score, but we would certainly have liked more. We're lucky enough to bat quite deep, and we usually go hard in that situation. We didn't manage to do it today. New Zealand bowled well. We thought the period between the end of our innings and the start of New Zealand's innings was the best time to bat, and we did well to create chances then.

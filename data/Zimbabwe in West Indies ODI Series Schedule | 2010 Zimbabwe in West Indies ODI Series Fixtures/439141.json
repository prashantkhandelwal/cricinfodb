Deonarine and Gayle finally managed to take West Indies home. The Guyana crowd told the story of the chase: you could almost hear the quiet when West Indies more than 30 overs without a boundary. The pressure built up and built up until home boy Deonarine opened up, and the crowd expressed its glee and cheered even singles. The big crowd - there despite the loss two days ago, there despite the drought - deserved a favourable result. Well done Zimbabwe nonetheless.

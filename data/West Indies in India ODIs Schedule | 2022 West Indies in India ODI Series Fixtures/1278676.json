I spoke to Rohit <i>bhai</i>, Virat <i>bhaiyya</i>, and realised that pace is important on this wicket. My usual slower pace won't work, because the quicker balls were spinning. I changed my line also, made it more middle and off. I bowl according to the pitch. I knew that here, the batters will find it easy to hit if I slowed it up. So I continued bowling quicker. You can bowl the odd slower one for variation. When I came back from South Africa, I watched each of my games three or four times to see where I was missing. I spoke to Rohit <i>bhaiyya</i> also after coming back and with Paras Mhambrey sir, our bowling coach. I worked on where I felt I was missing there."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Pollard</b>: Of course, losing with 22 overs to spare is not ideal.

Having said that, not the result we wanted, but credit to the guys for turning up. It has been a difficult last three days. It was pretty wet and the ball was sliding on [later in the evening]. When we batted, it held up and spun. We have to find a way. The lower-order batting from Jason and Fabian. Joseph and Akeal Hosein did the work for us with the ball - those were the positives.

The end goal is we should be able to achieve what the team wants - whether we want to bat or bowl differently. Honestly, I don't think we need to change a whole lot. All I will ask of the players it to challenge yourself and be innovative. I've been off for a while and didn't play for two months. I was back home, though, and hitting balls. It's about finding rhythm as a batter and I was confident going into this game. The pitch had something in it. There was softness early on and in this particular game the toss became important. But, if you keep ticking all the boxes, you can restrict any team and the same goes with the batting.

I didn't tell him [Hooda] anything. He has played domestic cricket for last seven years. It was important for him to stay till the end, and his confidence was spot on. I really liked it. Pollard told me a few things. 'Midwicket was open, why are you not flicking like you do in IPL' but it was different here. I feel the track was almost the same as it was in the afternoon. But due to dew, it became slightly easier in the chase."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>7.45pm</strong> That is that. India coast to a six-wicket victory in their 1000th ODI, which lasted only 71.5 overs. Washington and Chahal, the spinners, set it up by taking seven wickets between them to limit WI to 176. Rohit then played a blinder at the top on a tricky Motera track and although he and Kohli fell in the same over to Joseph, Suryakumar and debutant Hooda completed the job for India with plenty to spare.

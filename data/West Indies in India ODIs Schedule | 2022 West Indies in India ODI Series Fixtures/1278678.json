We have ticked a lot of boxes this series. Whatever we wanted to get out of the series, we got what we wanted. The noise will be around as long as we are playing. We know we are playing a high-profile sport in India and people look up to us and watch us. As players and individuals, we know what we need to focus on. The outside noise doesn't bother the dressing room. As long as we can come out and do what we are expected to do, that is very important. (Prasidh) We wanted bowlers to get bounce off the pitch, we had somebody who could come and bowl those lengths and ask those questions to the batters. It was good to see our fast bowlers, was impressed even with Siraj the way we bowled. And Shardul, Deepak got the opportunity at different times. Both Kuldeep and Chahal are crucial players for us. They have done well together as a group, especially Kuldeep since Chahal was very much in the plan but Kuldeep went off the radar a little bit. It was important to get him back, and get him back slowly. We do understand what he/they bring to the table, give them confidence and for them to try and do what's expected from them to do. We start expecting things little early, and we are pretty sure we can see them back together very soon. (Middle order today) With the top order not firing, it was good for the middle order to bail us out. Today they got us to a respectable total. This was the biggest positive.\"<BR><BR><B>Prasidh Krishna is the Player of the Series.</b> He says: \"Now that I've been practicing and played a few Vijay Hazare matches I have a few overs in me and am in rhythm. Anything going to the keeper or the slips, I like that kind of wickets. Today both wickets I got, it was quite nice to see the ball got the carry and good to have people behind who won't miss out when you create an opportunity. When you are running in and see the ball flying to the keeper, its what any fast bowler wants. The kind of guys we have in the team, everybody is good and we've been learning from each other. Anybody who turns up can do very well - that's the team effort. Still being grounded that way, its a team effort. If we look at the three games, we batted quite well even though the wicket had something.\"<BR><BR><B>Shreyas Iyer is the Player of the Match</b> He says: \"To be honest, life was really tough for me last two months. Had an infection and Covid, but this day has summed up for all those days. I am flexible to bat anywhere but No. 4 is the best number to bat at. If I am thrown into a pressure situation like today, I thrive on it and enjoy those moments. When I go in, like today's situation, I had to play off the new ball. For that you need to have good skill and play close to the body. From there you need to set the rhythm through the innings. Its not easy, but if you focus on your skills you can do it.\"<BR><BR><B>Pooran, the losing captain:</b> \"Wonderful opportunity. Must say congratulations to Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid - first white-ball series victory for them. The way we bowled in the series was wonderful. We have a lot of work to do with bowling and batting, more so batting this series. The way the boys bowled was fantastic. It seems like we are better at the shorter format, but we need to put in work in the longer format.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<B>9pm</b> We can see Rohit Sharma having a quiet chat with Kuldeep Yadav by the sidelines.

If he hits me from there, then its a good shot. Eventually was successful. The scrambled seam is my wicket-taking ball. Even in red-ball it works.

So I tried to target the spinners. I could've played 2-3 more overs. (When ball is now swinging) This wicket was different. You just have to pick the length since there was bounce. On flatter wickets, I need to do more pace and length variations. I have learnt a lot while batting with a bowling machine that if there isn't a variation then it is easy for a batter.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<B>8.45pm</b> And that's the first time India have done a clean sweep over West Indies in an ODI series.

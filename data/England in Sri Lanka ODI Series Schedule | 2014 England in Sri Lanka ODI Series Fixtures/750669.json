The batting let them down. From a great position set for a total close to 300, via James Taylor's superb 90, they faltered in the Powerplay and a collapse saw them post a below-par total. Imagine what even an extra 10-15 runs would have done? It was a very good effort with the ball but wides - 12 of them - and a crucial dropped chance of Mathews have seen them come unstuck."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Cool cookie Angelo Mathews has steered his side home with a fine captain's knock, keeping his head when England managed to make the hosts sweat. Mathews has brought up his fifty and also brought <b>victory by six wickets</b> in an excellent contest that's gone right to the final over. Great entertainment for the best crowd of the series but it's Sri Lanka now 3-1 up in the series with a steady run chase.

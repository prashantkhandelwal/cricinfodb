plan for. This one was drilled down the ground, the flick of the wrists, generated the power. It was destined to sail over wide long-on, but Kieron Pollard, lurking around the ropes, had other ideas. He ran around the ropes and then stretched full-length to his right to use every inch of his height to his advantage. Then plucked his hand out and was airborne as the ball got stuck in. Amazingly, he had the presence of mind to realise he was going over the ropes, and then gently lobbed the ball back, got back into the field of play, settled himself underneath to take the catch. Imagine he completed all of this in a matter of five seconds. Simply outstanding. He's done this time and again in the IPL, so it doesn't really come as a surprise.

Amazingly, he had the presence of mind to realise he was going over the ropes, and then gently lobbed the ball back, got back into the field of play, settled himself underneath to take the catch.

plan for. This one was drilled down the ground, the flick of the wrists, generated the power. It was destined to sail over wide long-on, but Kieron Pollard, lurking around the ropes, had other ideas. He ran around the ropes and then stretched full-length to his right to use every inch of his height to his advantage. Then plucked his hand out and was airborne as the ball got stuck in. Amazingly, he had the presence of mind to realise he was going over the ropes, and then gently lobbed the ball back, got back into the field of play, settled himself underneath to take the catch. Imagine he completed all of this in a matter of five seconds. Simply outstanding. He's done this time and again in the IPL, so it doesn't really come as a surprise.

The last few games have been good for us. The ball wasn't coming on well in the afternoon, but Sarfaraz and Babar batted gave us a good score. 287 was a good score on this pitch. We are trying to find the right combination and trying to bat deep as well, which is very important in one-day cricket. Fitness levels are also going up, so we are starting to tick the boxes. Limited-overs cricket is always a young man's game, so the way they (the youngsters) are absorbing pressure and delivering is heartening to see. Every game, we talk about needing to come out with the right attitude, hopefully we can keep doing that. We are focusing on improving ourselves and playing good cricket.

Pakistan did lose some ground after Azam's dismissal and a floodlight failure that led to a brief stoppage. But as it turned out, it proved to be more than enough. West Indies' response was tame and they were tied up in knots by the Pakistan spinners. Mohammad Amir and Hasan Ali opened the gates by dismissing the openers and Mohammad Nawaz scythed through their line-up with three quick wickets. From there, it was always uphill for West Indies, and as it turned out, they couldn't come anywhere close to the target.

plan for. This one was drilled down the ground, the flick of the wrists, generated the power. It was destined to sail over wide long-on, but Kieron Pollard, lurking around the ropes, had other ideas. He ran around the ropes and then stretched full-length to his right to use every inch of his height to his advantage. Then plucked his hand out and was airborne as the ball got stuck in. Amazingly, he had the presence of mind to realise he was going over the ropes, and then gently lobbed the ball back, got back into the field of play, settled himself underneath to take the catch. Imagine he completed all of this in a matter of five seconds. Simply outstanding. He's done this time and again in the IPL, so it doesn't really come as a surprise.

plan for. This one was drilled down the ground, the flick of the wrists, generated the power. It was destined to sail over wide long-on, but Kieron Pollard, lurking around the ropes, had other ideas. He ran around the ropes and then stretched full-length to his right to use every inch of his height to his advantage. Then plucked his hand out and was airborne as the ball got stuck in. Amazingly, he had the presence of mind to realise he was going over the ropes, and then gently lobbed the ball back, got back into the field of play, settled himself underneath to take the catch. Imagine he completed all of this in a matter of five seconds. Simply outstanding. He's done this time and again in the IPL, so it doesn't really come as a surprise.

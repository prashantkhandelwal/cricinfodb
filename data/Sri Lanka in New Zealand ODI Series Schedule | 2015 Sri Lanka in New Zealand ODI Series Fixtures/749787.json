Pace was certainly there in comparison to last year. Really good cricket wicket and crowd. We don't know yet about Milne (injured rib cage). The beauty of this team is that someone else will step up in case anything goes wrong. They expect us to fight hard and I will try to lead by example. Elliott had a tough time of late, but he showed strength of character and was one of the assets the selectors were keen to see.

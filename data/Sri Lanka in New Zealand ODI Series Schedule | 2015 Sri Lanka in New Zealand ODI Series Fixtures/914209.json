The match only lasted 36 overs, mostly because Sri Lanka's batsman just could not find an answer against New Zealand's pace. Then the chase only lasted 8.2 overs because the visitors were left in the dust again as Martin Guptill made an unbeaten 93 off only 30 balls. Let me repeat that ninety-bloody-three off only thirty bloody balls. With eight humongous sixes and nine fours. That means he ran only nine of his runs today. What the heck?!?

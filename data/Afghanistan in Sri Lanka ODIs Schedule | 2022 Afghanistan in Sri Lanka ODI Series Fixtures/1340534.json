Charith Asalanka stands tall on 83*, but it was 19-year-old Dunith Wellalage with his 21-ball 31 that revived Sri Lanka from the mat after Rashid Khan had landed some potentially knock out blows at the death. In fact the entire game was filled with potentially match-winning hands, starting with Ibrahim Zadran's 138-ball 162 - the highest ever score by a visiting batter in SL - followed by a 100-run opening stand between Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka, and then another crucial 79-run partnership between Asalanka and skipper Dasun Shanaka, before Rashid returned to strike some decisive blows on his way to figures of 4 for 37. But in the end it was Asalanka and Wellalage that remained, securing a win that will last long in the memory for the Lankans."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[{"id":349997,"objectId":1347276,"slug":"charith-asalanka-and-dunith-wellalage-celebrate-sri-lanka-s-record-breaking-chase","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/349900/349997.jpg","width":1400,"height":933,"caption":"Charith Asalanka and Dunith Wellalage celebrate Sri Lanka's record-breaking chase","longCaption":"Charith Asalanka and Dunith Wellalage celebrate Sri Lanka's record-breaking chase, Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan, 3rd ODI, Pallekele, November 30, 2022","credit":"SLC","photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/349900/349997.jpg","WIDE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/349900/349997.6.jpg","SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/349900/349997.10.jpg"},"dateTaken":"2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","capturedOn":{"year":2022,"month":11,"date":30}}],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":42138863,"id":42138863,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":49.03,"oversActual":49.3,"overNumber":50,"ballNumber":3,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":1,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":90,"wagonY":298,"wagonZone":5,"timestamp":"2022-11-30T17:03:21.000Z","modified":"2022-11-30T17:03:24.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":102835,"bowlerPlayerId":90231,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":308,"totalInningWickets":6,"predictions":null,"title":"Fazalhaq Farooqi to Wellalage","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"7 off 4."}],"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"good length on the stumps, heaved to wide long-on.

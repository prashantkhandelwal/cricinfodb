Travis and Ben played really well throughout the series. I think with the ball, Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott, Cameron Green, Adam Zampa bowled excellent throughout all three games. I thought there were a lot more positives than negatives. It was just we were on the receiving end of a couple of great knocks from Babar and Imam.

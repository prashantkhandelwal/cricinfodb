We knew we could chase that. Once you get into the middle overs, we had plans that one has to get through the overs. Luckily me and Babs got rid of the overs. We thought if we can stay there and chase it, alhamdulillah we were lucky today. There's always a margin of improvement for every batsman. I really appreciate all the criticism. We need to work more on strike rate but we really focus on the hurdle and on the management and what is important for us. We know in white ball cricket if you get set, you get runs quickly and that was the best example today. We wanted to back ourself and thank God we were very successful today. Everybody knows our friendship from about 2009. We know each other's games very well. We really back each other and have that belief that we can win matches.

Less dew tonight than there was the other night. The wicket played very well throughout the night. It was a beautiful one-day wicket. I thought we did quite well with the ball. There were just some times when Pakistan took the risks and they came off, which can happen in one-day cricket. When you've only got four players out in the middle overs of the game against some good players with a lot of options, it can be very hard to keep them on strike for a period of time and cut down the boundaries.

This is a lovely catch for a tall bowler, the height making them less athletic as fielders. Ahmed looks to work this full ball to leg, gets a leading edge and the ball loops to the left of Kumble, who is a little late to change cirection, but makes up for it with a full-length dive. This is a low catch so Ahmed is not keen to walk off straight away but Bucknor sends him off on his way. Replays show this has stuck in his left hand, and is a clean catch. This is his 100th ODI wicket"}],"fowOrder":6,"fowWicketNum":7,"fowRuns":232,"fowOvers":43.2,"fowBalls":null},{"dismissalBatsman":{"id":2033,"objectId":39015,"name":"Ata-ur-Rehman","longName":"Ata-ur-Rehman","mobileName":"","indexName":"Ata-ur-Rehman (Pakistan)","battingName":"Ata-ur-Rehman","fieldingName":"Ata-ur-Rehman","slug":"ata-ur-rehman","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/56700/56732.1.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1975,"month":3,"date":28},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["rhb"],"bowlingStyles":["rfm"],"longBattingStyles":["right-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["right-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":56732,"objectId":229748,"slug":"ata-ur-rehman","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/56700/56732.1.jpg","width":160,"height":231,"caption":"Ata-ur-Rehman","longCaption":"Ata-ur-Rehman","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":7,"playerRoleTypeIds":[4],"playingRoles":["bowler"],"headshotImage":null},"dismissalType":3,"dismissalComment":[{"type":"HTML","html":"oh Kumble is in a hurry.

This is a lovely catch for a tall bowler, the height making them less athletic as fielders. Ahmed looks to work this full ball to leg, gets a leading edge and the ball loops to the left of Kumble, who is a little late to change cirection, but makes up for it with a full-length dive. This is a low catch so Ahmed is not keen to walk off straight away but Bucknor sends him off on his way. Replays show this has stuck in his left hand, and is a clean catch.

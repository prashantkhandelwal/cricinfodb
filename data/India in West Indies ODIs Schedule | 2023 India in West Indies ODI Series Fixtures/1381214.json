Even in Tests we saw he can swing the new ball, has a bit of pace and quite consistent as well. So we want to see what he has to offer.

It's always good to have competition, but me and Chahal don't think about the competition and just work with each other.

For India, Kishan did well with the bat, but it was still at the top of the order so his middle order credentials could still come under questions, but he won't care about all that for now, having added a fine half-century to his resume.

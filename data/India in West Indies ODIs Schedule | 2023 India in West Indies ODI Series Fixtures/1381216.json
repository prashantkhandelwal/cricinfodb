We knew that if we failed, there was some disappointment. The way the boys came out and showed their character and at the same point of time they enjoyed it, that's something I want this team to have. In pressure situations, they have to absorb it but also enjoy it. Without pressure you can't be heroes. Obviously Virat and Rohit are very integral parts of the team. But this was very important for players like Rutu or Axar to get a game. So giving youngsters the exposure and making sure that if we want to check something, we can check that... [On his knock] Wanted to spend some time. Wicket was doing well. Had a wonderful chat with Virat a few days back. He had some great pointers. He wanted me to spend some time on the crease. That kind of stayed in my mind. I was just waiting to get the opportunity and once I got the rhythm I could get going. When I get one ball out of the middle, things become very different. I have seen that throughout my career. [On the India seamers] The ball was doing a bit. When you are chasing 350, batters will chase a few balls and they nick it and that's what happened to us. Couple of good catches by Shubman as well. Obviously West Indies woke up kind of late with that partnership and took the game to the 34th over but the game was over in the powerplay itself. This is one of the nicest grounds I have played in. A lot of things could be better when we come to West Indies last time, travelling and everything. Last time also some hiccups came. So WI board should also take a note. We don't want luxuries but some basic things are needed.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"WI captain, <b>Shai Hope</b>: \"Hindsight is the best sight. Obviously we saw how the wicket was in the back end but I think we restricted them well enough. We can look back and change many things but it is what it is. I don't think we put enough balls in that 6-8m especially with the new ball. We didn't challenge them enough. But we're still human beings and India batted well. But I think 350 was a gettable target. You have to believe that you can win. They got 350, you have to believe we can too. Just trying to keep stressing on that attitude. We are not consistent enough with that attitude. Some days we wake up and play like the best team in the world and some days we just get steamrolled.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Ishan Kishan</b>, the player of the series: \"Actually not so happy with the finish I gave. These wickets that we played on, I was supposed to score big. That's what I was told by my senior players that I have to get big runs, that's what makes normal players good players. Next time I will try to get big runs. I thinks it's important to be consistent. You have to forget about the last game and start from zero, just look at the ball and play and take it one match at a time. [On batting with Gill] I think he's a tremendous player, the way he middles the ball. So to see how he is playing well from the non-striker's end, it gives me confidence as well. It's always important to win at this level. After getting 350 we were trying to get wickets from early and we were not taking it easy. These are the conversations between the team and everyone is looking very positive. I've played a few tournaments here and know how the wicket plays here, so not focussing too much on the next T20 World Cup. We have important series coming up. So we need to stay in the present.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Shubman Gill</b> is the player of the match. Here's what he has to say: \"Very special for me, my first fifty on the tour. I was hoping to get a big score for the team, a hundred, but that didn't happen but the result was on our side. It was a good pitch to bat on but got difficult to bat on after the ball got older. It's all about playing the situation, assessing it as early as possible. As an opener it's your job to do give a good start to the team and fortunately I was able to do that. I think in the last match, I was set as well and looking for a big one. I was trying to accelerate and put pressure on the bowler. That's the way the one-day format is as well. I don't think about all those external factors. I don't think who's playing and who's not playing and just try to do my best.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Piyush: \"Can you help explain how that works (34.6)Umpire gave out caught behind.

They are also back to No. 1 in the one-day rankings. A solid performance from the home side, sparked by the bowling of Jade Dernbach who was excellent on his recall. He was backed up by Ravi Bopara and James Anderson, while James Tredwell also took two important wickets on his return to the team. With the bat, England knew all they had to do was bat out the overs and they'd win. Eoin Morgan gave the innings important impetus while Jonathan Trott played the ideal anchor knock. We'll bring you news of the Man of the Match shortly. I'd go for Dernbach, personally, as I thought he made the different with key wickets.

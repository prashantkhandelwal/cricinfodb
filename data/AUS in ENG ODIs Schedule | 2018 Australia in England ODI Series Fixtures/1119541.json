Time for the presentations, starting with <b>Jos Buttler</b>, who is named both Man of the Match and Man of the Series: [Sweeter victory after that?] \"Yeah it does, we were determined to come and and try and win 5-0, we bowled well but didn't quite do it with the bat. We just needed a partnership, once of the great strengths of this side is the depth in the batting, we kept chipping away, knew that if we got through the tricky periods we'd get out the other side. [Ball at the end?] I did say if it's two we'll run and then charged down first ball, but great guts to see out those balls.

[Anything you could have done differently?] We could have got a couple more wickets, we had them under pressure, Rashid and Jos played well and we didn't get enough balls in the right area. When we've been under pressure we haven't produced. We bowled a touch wide, but they played outstandingly well. [Was 205 enough?] I thought we were in trouble at halfway, our bowlers came out and committed really well to what we spoke about. But again, once we're under pressure, we folded, if we're honest. Today we saw Alex Carey and D'Arcy Short play really well after the senior players let us down, Billy Stanlake and Ashton Agar showed some real talent. [Captaincy, wicketkeeping, etc?] It's been difficult, but that goes with the job. When I came back in the Test side I tried to enjoy it, I probably let the pressure of this series get to me a little bit, if I'm honest.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"England captain <b>Eoin Morgan</b>: \"Massive positives to take, when times are tough and not enough of us have turned up, we bat all the way down the order and it means only one of us has to come off. Today Jos was quite mesmerising, playing with the lower order, we're very proud of what he did. He's come back form the IPL having dominated, he's forced his way back into the Test team, and he's a key part of our white-ball team. [Pleased to win or disappointed with manner?] We'd be naive to think we shouldn't ask questions, fact we won is a bonus, but we have to be honest about hew we went about it. That performance is not what we want to replicate. The bowling has come a long way, the game at Trent Bridge was pretty special  and how we fought back today was awesome. [Crowd happy with 5-0] Great atmosphere, fantastic support in Manchester, thanks for coming out and being absolutely brilliant, our 12th man today.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>5.35pm:</b> That is one of the great one-day innings from Jos Buttler, his sixth hundred and undoubtedly the one he has sweated most over. He leapt and punched the air as the ball disappeared to the rope, having almost single-handedly bailed out his side; England's next-highest score was 20! Credit to Adil Rashid for playing sensibly during a ninth-wicket stand worth 81 - although his blip threatened to give Australia a way back in - but that one goes on Buttler's mantelpiece. It's the first time Buttler has face 100 balls in an ODI, and what a day to do so. From 27 for 4, 50 for 5 and 114 for 8, England somehow clawed their way over the line to seal their first five-match series sweep over Australia."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":25237128,"id":25237128,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":48.02,"oversActual":48.2,"overNumber":49,"ballNumber":2,"totalRuns":0,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":158,"wagonY":180,"wagonZone":6,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2018-06-24T16:34:09.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":53271,"bowlerPlayerId":54212,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":204,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Stoinis to Buttler","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Australia really missing Starc here to clean up the tail!\" parps Aman Ajmani.

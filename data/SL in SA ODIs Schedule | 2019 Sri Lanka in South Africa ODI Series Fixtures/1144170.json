Being six down inside 18 overs, it's very hard to come back. We always talk about taking responsibility and putting our hands up to bat through the full fifty overs, but the last few years, we've been struggling to do that. Before we get to the World Cup, we have to realise that and get there. Some people don't realise their value and do their job for the national team. This is a good, tough side to play before the World Cup. All the players need to realise these are the conditions we need to prepare for at the World Cup.

Big picture, not the worst thing that Quinton and I got out today, because it gave those guys a chance. They were really solid. I like No. 3, I really enjoy it. But I can adapt my game between 3 and 4. We have guys who can bat in different positions, and that's important for the World Cup. Cape Town is always a good crowd, the guys are confident and there's a real good buzz in the squad. We might make one or two changes for the last game to make sure everyone gets an opportunity. We're playing some really good cricket. All the stuff that needed to happen over the last six months or year has happened. We're clear in what we want from a balance point of view.

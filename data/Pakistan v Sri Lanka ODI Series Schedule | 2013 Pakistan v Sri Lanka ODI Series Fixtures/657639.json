he gets the decision in his favour. Sharjeel has gone to <strong>review</strong> that.  The appeal sounded a bit strange to the naked eye as it seemed he had hit it with the bat, but the replays show that it has flicked the front pad before the bat. The batsman was stuck in the crease. The ball hit the pad in line with stumps, but there is a question about height. It is hitting the top of middle and Pakistan have lost their review. Good tight decision by the umpire though.

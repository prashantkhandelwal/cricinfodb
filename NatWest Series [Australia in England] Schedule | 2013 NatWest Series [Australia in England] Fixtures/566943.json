'i' not 'y'???). The bat was a heavy metal disk hooked on to a pulley system. There were rings round the pitch to indicate the runs scored. Metal ball. Once you'd got the timing right you could get a very high score! If you hit it hard enough, you could even bully a plastic fielder out of the way! (Not like my real life experience at all!!!) I played this game for hours when it was raining outside! Wish I'd still got it today! I was given an \"Owzat!\" set a only year or two back by my thoughtful young daughter. So it's still around. At school, back in the fifties, we also refined the pencil game, so that it was more realistic. We needed two pencils. This enabled us to have some balls from which no run was scored - and to indicate how exactly a player was dismissed. Not so many sixes, etc. We also had a game we played by allocating values and wickets to all the letters of the alphabet. Including dots. Rare letters used for rare events (eg. hit wkt).

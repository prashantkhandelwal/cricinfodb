None of the other batters looked comfortable against the spin except for Scot Edwards who used his feet well and maneuvered all over the park. Except for the top three none of the other batters managed to even reach the two figure mark. Akeal Hosein the chief destroyer once again bagged match winning 4 scalps.

The Dutch sniffed something special but was just a momentary bliss as Brandon King and Keacy Carty stitched a match defining century run partnership and saw their team home.

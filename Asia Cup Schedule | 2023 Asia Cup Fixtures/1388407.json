It bounces just short of his bat and then balloons up to the short cover fielder. The umpires go upstairs to check if it's a bump ball, but it isn't.

Yup, Mendis is walking. Bumrah gets him with a slower ball. Full and loopy outside off stump. Almost as full as the previous yorker, but at least partly because of that delivery, Mendis is worried about lbw and getting his front leg across, and by the time he realises it's a slower one he's reaching away from his body to play it. It bounces just short of his bat and then balloons up to the short cover fielder. The umpires go upstairs to check if it's a bump ball, but it isn't. Mendis gave it away anyway by beginning to walk before the umpires told him to wait. Clever, clever bowling from Bumrah.

(Captaincy in bowling effort) When they are 30 down for 3, we knew we needed a couple of more wickets, but unfortunately we didn't get that. Bowlers and spinners have been doing their bit for a long time now, just not enough runs on the board. (Positives for crunch games) There are lot of nerves when we started the game but as we kept on batting, in the 20th over, we felt lot more comfortable. This is the first time playing Asia Cup and in away conditions.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<B>Sadeera Samarawickrama:</b> (Came in at a difficult situation) We were two wickets down early so my plan was to bat positive but also continue my batting because we needed partnerships. (Conditions) Batting was not easy on this wicket - we saw for both teams. Spinning and bit slow to fast bowlers but I just backed myself. That's it. (Driving off the front foot and pull shots) I have always backed my strength, that's my strength in batting. I work hard for that, so any situation I back these shots.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<B>9.51pm</b> This is the <b>11th consecutive win for Sri Lanka in ODIs.</b> A convincing win for Sri Lanka sets them atop Group B, the group of death, while Bangladesh know that their game against Afghanistan on Sunday is now a must-win. A game played in good spirits, no dance moves displayed on the field atleast.<BR><BR>The positives for Bangladesh were Shanto's well-built innings and their fielding effort. Otherwise, Sri Lanka were too hot on the day, and also showed their bowling bench strength is very strong too. Pathirana's four-for led their bowling effort, but Theekshana, de Silva and Wellalage were great too. And then, despite an early hiccup, Sri Lanka rebuild on the back of a strong partnership from Samarawickrama and Asalanka. Both batters finished with half-centuries, a confidence booster ahead of their next game on Tuesday against Afghanistan."}],"commentVideos":[{"id":132999,"objectId":1395450,"scribeId":38299155,"statusTypeId":3,"slug":"watch-charith-asalanka-wins-it-with-a-four","title":"Watch - Charith Asalanka wins it with

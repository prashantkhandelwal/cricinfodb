Early wickets for Bhuvi, and really happy for Kuldeep as well, bowling for the first time and taking three wickets. The bench strength has always been right up there for us. Jinks couldn't get a game in the Champions Trophy unfortunately, but shows his mental strength, steps in and scores runs.

I thought we were tight to their openers, but Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane are quality players, they played some good shots, beat the infield. Today I probably struggled a little with the wet ball [the high full-tosses]. I thought Shai played really well, he showed good intent, and got good support from Evin Lewis. Good to see Roston Chase coming in at the end and getting some runs as well.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>5.34pm</b> This match is officially over now, but it ended hours ago.

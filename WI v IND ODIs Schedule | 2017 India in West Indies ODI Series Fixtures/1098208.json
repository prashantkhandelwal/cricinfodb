In my mind I had 250, and we got there, with Kedar batting with me at the end. It was something the bowlers could defend, but they had to bowl well. It's important [to instruct and mentor spinners]. Kuldeep has played a lot of games, IPL, T20 format. When it comes to international cricket, it's important to know where to use your variety. Once he plays 5-10 games, he will realise it himself.

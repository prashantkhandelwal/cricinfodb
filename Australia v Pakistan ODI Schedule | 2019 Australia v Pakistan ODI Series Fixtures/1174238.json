A very efficient run chase, led by Aaron Finch's century which Shaun Marsh supporting him well. It never really looked in doubt from a long way out. Earlier, Australia's spinners did a very good job on a slow surface as Pakistan never really got away from them with the bat. Haris Sohail made a good hundred, and there was a bit of a dart in the final five overs, but there was a lack of power for much of the innings. Australia's one-day momentum continues to build nicely.

Must say the way Finch and Marsh batted, they controlled the innings and took it deep. You can always make things better, we gave away some extra singles when batsmen are set. A few areas to improve.

A great sign for Pakistan cricket.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Aaron Finch</b> (who is also Man of the Match) \"It was to chase down that total, was pretty daunting but it played really well in the second half.

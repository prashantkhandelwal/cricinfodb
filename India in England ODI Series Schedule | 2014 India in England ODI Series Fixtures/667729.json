It also ends a run of five consecutive ODI defeats for England, so some small comfort for Alastair Cook too."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":11467161,"id":11467161,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":48.04,"oversActual":48.4,"overNumber":49,"ballNumber":4,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":1,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":49247,"bowlerPlayerId":48529,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":253,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Finn to Jadeja","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Reminds me of that Misbah innings in the World Cup semi-final, this.

The seamers bowled in the right areas and it was crucial becaise i thought it wouldn't turn much. The fast bowlers set it up, because they took wickets and when the spinners came the batting was under pressure. The openers, if they can face 10 to 12 overs, it gives us a platform. It was good to see Dhawan back in form. Rahane was always someone who was third in line for the opening slot and he has made the most out of it. He is a good timer which makes it slightly easy for him. It's a spot that suits him. Rohit is a very talented guy and we are not making any decisions (on opening) as yet. I feel a lot of credit goes to the seniors I played under and the youngsters.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Ajinkya Rahane</strong> is the Man of the Match. He says, \" Feels really great when you get a 100 and the team wins. Credit goes to the bowlers as well for setting up the match. I was batting well after the first few games and I was focussing to stay there. Really happy for Dhawan, the way he batted was special. We just wanted to enjoy the game. It's a great challenge to open, you have to prepare your mind.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"A very tough day. The sport turns change so quickly. It is frustrating not to play to your potential. says<strong> Alastair cook</strong>. \"We were going to bat first anyway. India certainly batted better, fielder better, and bowled better. It is always tough to lose three games in a row and in a manner that we lost. There is a World Cup a few months away and you have to show you are hungry. We just need to look at ourselves and improve. There is potential but we need to improve. Moeen batted very well. He was the only guy to have a good day today. We are pretty clear on the personnel we need, but if people do not sore runs, or take wickets.. they certainly have the potential.. They need to turn up.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"It is  great feeling to win a match like this,\" says <B>Dhawan</B>. \"We had a hard time during the Test series. We didn't know that we broke record for the opening wicket. Rahane was in a good flow, that relieved pressure for me. I really enjoyed his batting. When I came here, I wanted to look at the technique. Ravi (Shastri) bhai gave me some tips which really helped me.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"We knew he was just one innings away from good form,\" continues <B>Rahane</B>. \"I enjoyed his batting from the other end. It was really hurting that I got out cheaply. Today I was very determined. I was planning to hit a six when I was on 44. It's still long way to go (for WC). It was really tough for us in the Tests, so it was a good win.

The win also makes Dhoni the most successful captain for India."},{"type":"HTML","html":"India started the chase watchfully, then came that over from Anderson in which Rahane picked up four exquisite boundaries and there was no turning back. If England want a positive from this match, it's probably Moeen Ali's batting but that cannot take away from the ignominy of being absent in the second innings. Rahane was superb, dancing his way to his maiden ODI century with a posse of delightful strokes.. He hit a few sixes, but never looked like hitting the ball. Dhawan grew in confidence and this 97 would go a long way in calming his nerves towards his immediate future."},{"type":"HTML","html":"The Indian bowlers were brilliant too.

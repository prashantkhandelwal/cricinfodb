Zimbabwe will have to have a hard look at their batting once again as the final game beckons on Saturday. Will they put up a better show then? As for Australia, Finch's returns with the bat could be a concern for them. Will they look to bat first in the final ODI? Do join us on Saturday to find out. That's all we have for you today.

doesn't cost him much. This is excellent bowling. Finch's circumspect nature around the off stump causes his downfall and Ngarava does well to exploit it. Bowls the in-between length - neither too fall nor a good length. He is uncertain whether to go forward or play back and just hangs his bat out after getting half-forward. The ball takes the inside edge and clatters the stumps.

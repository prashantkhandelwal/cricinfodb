We felt as though we needed an extra spinner based on how dry the square looked and how the Test wicket played as well. There's not a huge amount of grass out there. We come here with a real open mind to be flexible with the team we select and some different roles that the guys play so I'm really proud of the way that the guys took on that challenge. It's very wet now. The guys were struggling toward the back end to hold the ball. Like Babar said, if you get some in batters, it can be slightly easier.

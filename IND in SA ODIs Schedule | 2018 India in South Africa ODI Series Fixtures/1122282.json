Wowow. Stunner from the captain. And it's a big moment too, because it's Pandya. A full delivery outside off, Pandya is hurried for pace so he can't get a lot of power behind that, the ball lobs off the outside half towards cover. But it isn't over Markram, who times his jump to absolute perfection. At the highest point in his leap, he grasps the ball and holds on, with both feet well off the ground. A lot of things needed to go well for that catch to be taken and it was. STUNNER! Gasps from the crowd as the replays are shown.

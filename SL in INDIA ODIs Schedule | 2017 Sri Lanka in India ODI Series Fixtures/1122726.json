Not enough runs on the board. The bowlers came out and did what they could. If we had 70-80 more runs, it could have been different, but we lost the match with the bat today. We want to thrive in these type of conditions and come out good. We won't always get to play on flat pitches. Today was not the ideal day for all our batters. It was an eye-opener. Hopefully we can regroup and come back in the next two matches. [Dhoni] has done it for so many years and he knows exactly how to bat in these situations. Someone else with him could have made the difference but he was battling alone.

The way Suranga Lakmal set the tone was fantastic, followed by all the other bowlers. We never thought it was going to move around that much. We knew it was a bit sticky. In the shorter formats, I've always bowled, and I want to bowl. It's just the workload management in the Test matches, and the selectors were very understanding.

Back of a length, slanting across, but this one comes back into Thirimanne. Caught on the crease again, shuffling across but not going forward or back. Bat comes down at an angle, and he chops it back onto his stumps. They're checking for no-ball once again, and this is hilarious. From one angle, his front heel is hidden behind the non-striker's bat, and from the other it's hidden behind the midwicket fielder. The stump-cam angle was inconclusive too, with the heel landing extremely close to the back of the line - whether behind it or on top of it was hard to tell - and given the evidence he had, the third

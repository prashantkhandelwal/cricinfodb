Winning the game was important for me and the team after that loss in Dharamsala. I can keep talking about the batting that we did today, right from the start, with Shikhar giving us a brilliant start, and Shreyas Iyer - it didn't look like he was only playing his second ODI. There was dew later, so it was important to get that big total. If I'm not wrong, the first 100 I got were around the 38th, 39th over, so I was telling myself, if I get that far, I'm not going to get out. I was only looking to keep my shape and hit through the line. It was the same thing I did in my first two 200s. I started off pretty slow then too. Very difficult to pick one. All three came at crucial times. 264 is obviously very close to me. I've said it many times, but I honestly cannot pick one. The Australia one was a decider, the Sri Lanka 264 - I came back after a three-month layoff after a big injury, and this one also - after a humiliating loss, we wanted to come back as a team, as a batting unit especially. I'm happy [my wife] is here with me on this special day. I know she would have liked this gift from me. She's been my strength, she's always been there for me. You go through so much stress in this sport, and having them around is always special. This is our second anniversary, but more than that, we won the game. We were determined to do the right things in the middle, and right till the end we did that. As a group we're looking forward to [Vizag]. The conditions will be different, and again we have to adapt and play to our strengths. Not the ideal conditions for [Washington] to bowl, but this is how he will learn. He showed promise, and he has shown it before too, in the IPL. We want to back young players like Washington, we don't want to put too much pressure on them. I'm sure he must have learned a lot from this game, bowling with the wet ball and so on, and I wish him all the luck.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Thisara Perera</b>: \"Unfortunately our bowling didn't click. Especially Rohit batted really well. That is cricket. We will take positives from this match and flush out the negatives. We had a Plan A and B and C as well - it didn't click. That's why I said Rohit batted really well. If we want to chase this kind of score, we need a good start, and middle order as well. Both parts didn't click, but Angelo did well in the batting part. We will come back well in the third ODI.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Shikhar Dhawan</b>: \"I was happy with my flow today. Would have loved to continue, but I really enjoyed my game today and gave my team a good start. We also thought it was going to be a bit more damp. It was coming a bit slow, but I still knew I could play my shots and disturb the bowlers' line and length, which helped me as well as Rohit to go a long way. I knew, because their strength was to bowl on one good area - they have been bowling to me at 5th or 6th stump on a length where I cannot cut or drive - so I tried to step out to disturb their length. It's a bit of a risk, but I enjoy taking risks. At the start, Rohit took his time, and then later on he started hitting boundaries. Once I was out, I knew he was going to score a big innings.

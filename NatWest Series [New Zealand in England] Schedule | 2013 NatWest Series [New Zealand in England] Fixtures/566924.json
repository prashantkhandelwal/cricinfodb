We were trying to grab wickets because we know how important they are. [Lacking Broad and Finn] would be too easy an excuse and probably does New Zealand a disservice but we need to look at our plans for the Champions Trophy.

The way England batted, if we weren't able to pick up those wickets they were a live chance. We decided to bat first and you've got to post something to defend. The intent Martin and Kane Williamson showed at the start, they got us into a position. I had a bit of fun at the end but I was just a passenger in the Martin Guptill show. It's been really pleasing after the Test series, we're an experienced one-day unit and we're hard to beat. When the Champions Trophy rolls around we've got to play as well as we can.

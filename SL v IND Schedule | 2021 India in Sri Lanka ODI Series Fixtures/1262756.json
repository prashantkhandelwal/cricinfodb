His presence of mind, his calculation - in the last four overs they didn't take on the legspinner because at the time he was lethal. I felt that the way Sri Lanka planned their innings, batting and bowling - they brought the spinner on early - and the way they fielded was good to watch and learn.

This is big moment for Chahar - India have struggled with a thin lower order for years now in this format. This is a big step in the way of a senior team call-up for him. A run-a-ball 84-run stand for the eighth wicket takes India home. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, with his experience of pulling off a chase very similar to this in Sri Lanka, unbeaten on 19 at the other end. The deeper this game got, the more and more it felt like it was India vs Wanindu Hasaranga. The fast bowlers took some tap, and these two seemed to calculate for that. They played Hasaranga out and trusted themselves to get through the others, and they've done it with five balls to spare. This will sting Sri Lanka so much - they absolutely bossed India in the middle overs. They had India 116 for 5 at one stage, and they tied Krunal Pandya up. But SKY kept one side going and Krunal took it deep enough. Still - it was Sri Lanka's game to lose at that point. And they just couldn't finish it off. Got to feel for them. The errors crept in at the end, and it's another reality check that there is some way to go for this team.

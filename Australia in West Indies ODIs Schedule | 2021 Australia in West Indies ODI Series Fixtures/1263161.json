[On the batting performance] It is what it is. My biggest thing in that is that I want the guys to fight. Just because the ball is swinging or moving, don't just give it away with soft dismissals. Let them work for your wicket. Because sometimes it's good ball, [doesn't] mean that you have to get out to it. The most important factor to me is we didn't show that sort of fight. We knew Australia is very dangerous with the new ball and that's where they look to pounce on oppositions. Once we can fight through that, watching the rest of the attack I think it's something we can manage.

We won the toss and we batted and I thought the wicket might have played a little bit different to what it did. But for us to adapt and put a score on the board, but then for the Powerplay to go the way it did for us was fantastic. Ashton played a really crucial role.

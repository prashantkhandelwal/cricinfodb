India's seamers set it up with Zaheer marking an excellent return after not playing the first couple of games, and the spinners then doing their bit. On a track that needed at least 270, New Zealand mustered 224 and true to the track's reputation, the chase was easy with Gambhir leading the way.

It's good for Indian cricket. Any hundred would be important because I have seen a lot of low scores in the recent past.

That's a mad, mad piece of running, to go with a really special piece of fielding. Fuller outside off, Kamran got forward and opened the face, looking to steal a single to the off side. It went quickly to Mills at short third man. Kamran had committed himself to the single and went too far before noticing that Mills had fielded and lined up the stumps even as he was recovering from the tumble. Too late. Dead on throw, on the bounce into the stumps.

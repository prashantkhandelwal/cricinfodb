Points\n\n21.9.1 Preliminary Matches\n\nIn a competition with three or four Members with ODI status and with a final match or series, the home Board will institute a points system as follows:\n\nWin, with bonus point - 5<br>\nWin, without bonus point - 4<br>\nTie or No Result - 2<br>\nLoss - 0\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points, the right to play in the final match or series will be determined as follows:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The team with the most number of wins\n<li>If still equal, the team with the most number of wins over the\nother team(s) who are equal on points and have the same number of wins\n<li>If still equal, the team with the highest number of bonus points\n<li>If still equal, the team with the highest net run rate\n</ul>\n\nIn a match declared as no result, run rate is not applicable.\n\n21.9.2 Net Run Rate\n\nA team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\n\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\n21.9.3 Bonus Points\n\nThe team that achieves a run rate of 1.25 times that of the opposition shall be awarded one bonus point. A team's run rate will be calculated by reference to the runs scored in an innings divided by the number of overs faced. Refer <a href=\"/db/DOWNLOAD/100/0119/appendix6.pdf\">Appendix 6</a>.\n\n21.9.4 Final Match or Series\n\nIf no result is achieved in a final the match shall be declared drawn. In the event of a drawn final, the prize money will be shared\nequally between the two competing teams.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"teamStats":[{"teamInfo":{"id":6,"objectId":6,"scribeId":6,"slug":"india","name":"India","longName":"India","abbreviation":"IND","unofficialName":"","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/313100/313128.logo.png","isCountry":true,"primaryColor":"#137dd2","image":{"id":313128,"objectId":1241587,"slug":"india-logo","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/313100/313128.logo.png","width":500,"height":500,"caption":"India

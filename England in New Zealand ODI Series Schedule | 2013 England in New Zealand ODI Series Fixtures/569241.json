Steven [Finn] seemed to generate more pace off his shorter run-up. We knew if we kept our heads batting, it was quite an easy chase. [Joe Root] has been excellent, has a lot of talent and is working very hard, but we need to keep his feet on the ground, you know what these Yorkshiremen are like!

England put pressure on us early on with the ball and played brilliantly with the bat. Credit to James Anderson pushing into the wind, but we gave ourselves some opportunities and if we'd got to 300, we might have had a better chance. Pleased for Ross to bounce back with a hundred and hit some form. The pace bowlers couldn't quite hit the lengths so I though Nathan and Kane did very well.

Obviously we wanted to bounce back after the disappointment of Hamilton and it was great for the guys to take us home. There was a bit of bounce in the pitch and we stuck at it, despite Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum who played very well. We knew the average score here was 300 so once we kept them below that, we were in with a chance.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"That was a thoroughly professional performance today from England, who only lost control of the game during Taylor and McCullum's devastating partnership. Either side of that, the bowling was parsimonious at the beginning and recovered well after the onslaught to clean out the home side's tail, Anderson grabbing five wickets for only 34. Their run chase then progressed very smoothly, never looking in any real trouble after Cook and Bell had set them on their way before Cook and Trott carried on to a point where the precocious Joe Root could show off his range of skills with Trott quietly chugging away in the background. In terms of the series, this result sets up a tantalising decider on Saturday at Auckland's Eden Park - 1-1 it is!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"Dan: \"I think a lot of the problem around Trott is pure perception - this is a very good innings, but he's only scored three boundaries so people say he's useless.

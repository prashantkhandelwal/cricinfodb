It was an ideal pitch, fast outfield, but you need to keep the shape as a batsman, that's what they did well. Our batting is looking good, but it's unfair to assume the batsmen are going to chase a 300+ target everytime.  Most of our guys have played international cricket, but most of them don't have the experience of a Yuvraj Singh who has played over 250 matches, what you have to do is to be aggressive, but what is important is that you don't have to slog, you have to maintain good shape.

Pakistan let the game for a long time in the second half, but they were outdone by the entirety of Sri Lanka's specialist batsmen who played some terribly ordinary shots on a good batting surface. From 28 for 5, they had no business lasting even another hour. But Shehan Jayasuriya and Dasun Shanaka, two of many players on this tour trying to prove a point, took their chances. They were positive despite the damage around them. They kept tucking the ball away, maintaining a rate of five per over until suddenly upping the rate and giving Pakistan a right scare. But Usman Shinwari, the architect of the early collapse, was there in the end to drag the game back for Pakistan. A second five-for, getting Jayasuriya for 96, and stamping his name all over this chase. A good day for him. Also a good day for Babar Azam, celebrating his first Karachi ODI with his 11th ODI ton. Iftikhar at the end with a cameo too, took Pakistan past 300.

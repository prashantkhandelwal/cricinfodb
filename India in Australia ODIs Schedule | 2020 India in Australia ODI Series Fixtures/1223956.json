Australia have taken the series at the first opportunity. They've been the clearly superior team in both games. It's goodbye from Alex, Thilak and me for now, but make sure you tune in for the third ODI after a couple of days."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Moises Henriques:</strong> It is the most I've bowled for a little while so I was starting to get a bit sore there towards the end. Just tried to bowl as straight as possible. If you could hit the right length, it worked. I just tried to smack that length with changes of pace. (on his catch off Kohli) Yeah it was a really big wicket. I wouldn't be out of place in saying I'm pretty sure after we got Virat that a lot of guys were a lot calmer on the field. Thankfully he didn't hit it as well as he wanted to and I was able to get across without thinking too much. Those two innings from Steve... I've been lucky enough to play a lot of cricket with him and the timing he's showed in both games is extraordinary. You look up and he's 40 off 30 and you've not realised it. He's able to accelerate and score all around the field. I haven't seen him time the ball as well as he has in those two innings. The boys keep taking the mickey out of him because he says to anyone who'll listen 'he's found his hands' but maybe there is something in it!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Aaron Finch:</strong> It was I guess (perfect perfomance with the bat). Anytime you get in the high 300s is good. Very pleased to wrap it up in two wins. No idea (on Warner's fitness). We've got to reshuffle it around, I don't think he'll be available. Bit quicker would have been nice (on his own batting) but laid the foundation for the guys at the back end to come and play free cricket. The way Davey played up front was unbelievable. Then Smithy played out of his skin for two matches in a row. Henriques bowled to a simple plan and changed his pace a lot. As Virat said, we probably got a blueprint with Hardik's bowling, he was really hard to hit with pace off deliveries."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Virat Kohli:</strong> Completely outplayed. I think with the ball we were not that effective. Didn't hit the areas we wanted to consistently. They've got a strong batting lineup and know the angles. Their total was a bit too steep, if you see we got 340 and still lost by 51 runs. With the areas they bowled, they were in a position to create chances and with those chances taken, they were on top. (on Hardik bowling) I think he gave away a bit of a bowling plan on this pitch, a lot of them bowled cutters (smiles). His bowling was out of nowhere I just asked him. KL and I thought even 100 in the last ten overs with Hardik to come was achievable. If KL and me had stuck around till the 40th over, we could have put them under pressure. The wicket was beautiful to bat on."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Steve Smith is Man of the Match again:</strong> I think last innings I probably could have been caught at long on, a close lbw. I didn't give any chances today and I just felt good from ball one. I was able to get myself in and go hard. Another great foundation set by Finchy and Davey. Let me go hard at the back end. The last two games, the boys have got us off to terrific starts. We know India have a good batting line-up so we needed big totals. I tried to whack the ball too hard in the IPL but I've started hitting it with more finesse I should say, which is working for me. Nice to score some runs again for the team and get us to a good total. I thought the boys were outstanding in the field as well."},{"type":"LIVE_STREAM","url":"https://livestream.com/accounts/6115179/events/9421941"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>10.46 pm</b> Australia take the series with an unbeatable 2-0 lead. Two comprehensive wins, driven by their batting. Both times they put up totals that were just beyond what could be achieved. India's batting was solid enough but they had too much to chase. The bowling will cause some worries. Australia's batting is looking very robust indeed. David Warner back to his attacking best, Steven Smith batting like a dream, and Glenn Maxwell scoring at two runs per ball for fun. The only bowling worry for Australia is Starc being off-colour. His figures might not reflect it, but he bowled better than in the first game. There was that no-ball wicket, and if he can sort out the extras, it will automatically improve things."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Better over-rates in this game incidentally.

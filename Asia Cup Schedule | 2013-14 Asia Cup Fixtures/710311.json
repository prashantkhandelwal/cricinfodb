We recovered well after that, but we  could have added 25-30 runs more. Just could not build enough pressure with the ball. It wasn't the pressure of the final. Just didn't execute our plans. We wanted not to give Lasith any wickets and in the end he took all our wickets. You need partnerships in the bowling as well. Saeed was bowling really well, but we were leaking runs in the other end. Batting was a positive sign in the series, Shehazad and Afridi and Alam and Akmal and Hafeez all played really good knocks, They batted sensibly and contributed really well.

Very measured innings from both of them. We all know Mahela's ability to make it count even against all odds, but Thirimanne has risen in this series and seems to relish opening the batting. Seems a very bright prospect for the future. Spare a thought for Saeed Ajmal though. He has been beyond masterclass all through the series.

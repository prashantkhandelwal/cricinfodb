[Powerplay approach?] I tried to be positive, different to Paul but we dovetailed well, and we created the big partnership which went a long way to winning the game. [Super League] It's going to be a scrap for us, we have to be competitive in all our games, we're grateful for the opportunity to come here, to the ECB for putting it on, and to come away with 10 points.

We weren't on top of our game today. We're learning more about players coming in and have opportunities to show what they can to. David WiIley, Sam Billings, Tom Banton, the bowling unit...

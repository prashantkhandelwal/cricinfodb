[McCarthy injury?] Haven't caught up with him, Barry's been leading our attack, big part of the squad and hopefully it's not too serious.

He and Saqib were outstanding, they really did peg Ireland back.

The more times we can see guy sin pressure situations, the more we can find out about them. [Billings took chance] Today was a good example, some guys didn't come off, but there'll be similar situations and we want guys to push to be in our strongest 15. [Strength in depth] Great feeling, down to the success of the 17-18 over last four years, the guys who held on to their spots have excelled and added to the value of the team, so you need to do something special to get into the final 15.

At 29 for 5, there was a real danger of this being a sub-100 score, and thereby an absolute cake walk for the hosts.

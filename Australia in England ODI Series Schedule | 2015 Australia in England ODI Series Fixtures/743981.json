Probably got 20-30 than we would have liked, but knew the pitch would play into our hands. We want guys to make matchwinning contributions and James Taylor did that. I thought they [the spinners] were outstanding. We knew the new ball would set the tone because it was easier facing the new ball so Steve Finn was really impressive, then for the two spinners to bowl with such control I was not surprised but very impressed. There were some outstanding catches. [On Finn] He's like a leaping salmon at midwicket.

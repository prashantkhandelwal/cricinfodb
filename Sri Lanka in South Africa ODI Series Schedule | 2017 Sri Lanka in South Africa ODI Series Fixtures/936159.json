A total of 181 was never going to be enough and there were no surprises during the chase. Sri Lanka's spinners did occasionally find a way past the edges of South Africa's batsmen but South Africa had the luxury of taking their own time given the small target. Early wickets were going to be the only way for Sri Lanka to try and make a game of this, but once Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla got off to a steady start, it steadily shut the doors on a Sri Lankan fightback. Hashim Amla was calm and languid as ever, all silken tough and grace as he stroked his way to a fluent half-century. Faf du Plessis may not have been as pretty, but played an equally effective innings. And AB de Villiers got in some good match batting practice on his ODI return. Stay tuned. We will bring the presentations to you shortly."},{"type":"HTML","html":"A: \"@Vishaal SA may have played a depleted side but Sri Lanka's 'full strength' team is a side full of newcomers each with a handful of games under their belt.

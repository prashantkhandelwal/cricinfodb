Had a lot of chances, and luckily I made it count. Two guys stood out today, first of all Faf. I know he's had a rough start to his ODI career, but he is in magnificent form. The other guy is Imran Tahir. It was a good wicket, but areas to improve on. Too many extras. I think there is enough experience to carry the young guys through and carry them forward. I think the hunger we showed, especially in the last series against Sri Lanka, and I was very pleased to see that hunger again today.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Kranthi: \"When was the last time (in an ODI) that every Australian bowler's economy rate went up over 6?\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>5.25pm</b> Australia will be shell-shocked by how easy it was for South Africa.

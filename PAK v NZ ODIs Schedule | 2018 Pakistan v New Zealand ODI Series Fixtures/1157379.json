A sensational bowling performance after New Zealand had elected to bat. They got early wickets, and then the spinners put up some magic for this era of cricket - they conceded only one boundary in 25 overs between them. Ross Taylor toiled hard, but he couldn't do too much after Shaheen Afridi had ripped through the line-up. Fakhar Zaman finally got in the runs, Babar was fluid as ever and the experienced Prof. saw them through with nearly 10 overs to spare. Hardly a blemish in today's performance and if it weren't for Imam's head injury, this would have been a perfect day. Imam is in the hospital for scans and he was conscious on the way.

Exhausted right now. I'm more proud of our second innings than our first. Vijay Shankar batted outstandingly, but he was unfortunately run out and we lost Kedar and MS in quick succession. I was thinking of using Vijay in the 46th over, but I spoke to Rohit and MS, and they said, let's stick with Shami and Bumrah, and if they get some wickets we're on top, and that's exactly what happened. Vijay kept it stump-to-stump, kept it simple, and it worked. It's always nice to speak to Rohit, he's the vice captain, MS has been around for so long, and you go and speak to the bowler as well. Invariably they're all on the same page. Bumrah is a champion, two wickets in an over, just turned the game, happy to have him in our team. Just coming through these kinds of games gives us confident. It's important to look ugly at times, and come through and win. We might get these low-scoring games in the World Cup as well. This kind of a pitch was tailormade for Kedar Jadhav, he was actually keen to bowl the last over as well. It felt good [to get to 40 ODI hundreds]. It's just a number, but it feels good to win games for India.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Aaron Finch</b>: \"It was one of those games where you take it as deep as you can and hope you can get over the line. Marcus Stoinis played a brilliant innings. The game ebbed and flowed the whole day. We had momentum, gave it back to them, and in the end they got over the line. If Stoin takes a risk early on and gets out, we have no chance at all, so his approach was right. Was okay to get a start today, but starts don't win games. We got 30s and 40s, they got a hundred, and that was the difference. Virat was the difference in the game. If one of our top order got 80-100, we would have probably won the game.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Piyush: \"Bumrah 2/10 in his last 6 overs.. How many times has he done this?!!

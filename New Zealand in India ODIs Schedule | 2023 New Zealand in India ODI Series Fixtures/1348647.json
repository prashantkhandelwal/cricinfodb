You can expect these performances away from India, but they have real skills. When we trained here yesterday in the night, it moved around, there was good carry. Which is why we wanted that challenge: 250 would have been quite challenging. Shami and Siraj did want to go on for longer spells, but I told them a big Test series coming up. I had to step in and say boss there are other bowlers as well. I am happy with my batting. I have kept my approach quite similar. I try to take the bowlers on. It is important to do that: to try to out the pressure back. I know a big score hasn't come, but I am happy with how I am going. I know a big score is around the corner.\".<br><br>Tom Latham is the first one to speak first. And I paraphrase: \"Batting up top wasn't our finest day.

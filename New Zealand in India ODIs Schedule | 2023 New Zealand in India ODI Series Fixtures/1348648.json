We're consistent in our approach with the bat and ball. Without Siraj and Shami we wanted to give opportunities to other guys on the bench. We wanted to bring Chahal and Umran in the mix, put them under pressure. We had runs on the board, but on this kind of ground no total is safe. We stuck to the plans, held our nerves. Shardul has been doing this for a while, so some people call him 'Magician'. every time I've given Kuldeep the ball, he brings wickets. Just need to give him more games under his belt, because wristspinners get better as they play more. His [Gill's] approach is quite similar. He starts afresh. As a young players that is important. He can easily sit on top of his laurels and take it easy, but he doesn't. 20th century means a lot to me, it was important to play long and take the team to a good total. Honestly, we don't talk too much about rankings. It's about winning games and it won't be different when we play the Tests against Australia. It won't be an easy challenge but we're up for it."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Gill is the Player of the Series</b>: Feels nice and when you perform well. It's satisfying.

I feel good and fully prepared to play the sport. I'm glad Shardul has faith in me and in our partnership it was combined but I'm grateful he listened to me.

Earlier India were looking set for 400-450 and would't have been completely happy with this total. But a Finn Allen duck followed by quick strikes from Shardul Thakur in the middle overs - when he got two in two - dented NZ's chances severely.

Rohit and Dhawan got the show off to a blazing start, then it was left to the integral middle-order of Raina and Dhoni to try and stabilise things after some wickets fell in a cluster. It finally ended with some outstanding striking from Ashwin and Jadeja. So as it stands New Zealand still lead the five-match ODI series 2-0, and India will be buoyed by the fact that they still remain very much in the series, and even though they can not win it outright, they can still save face and square the series.

But if we are to pick situations where we could have closed the game quite comprehensively, those were the situations we did not grab. It is a bit disappointing, but overall a good result as it keeps us alive in the series. Even if we can't win it, we can go for the draw. I think the straight boundaries were quite short, and even the bowlers who bowled quick, their strengths are all about going full and going for yorkers, and when it doesn't then it tends to be hit down the ground. I think overall 300 would have been fantastic, and we had a chance but we couldn't quite do it. I had faith in them (Ashwin and Jadeja), but my problems started when Jadeja told Bhuvi what he needs to do. Ashwin should have batted till the end, but this is also the first time he was put into a position like this. I definitely feel like he is someone who can definitely bat like a batsman, and has improved his power hitting as well, which he has been working on."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Brendon McCullum, NZ captain</b>: I thought it was a brilliant game of cricket. India showed why they are one of the powerhouses of India cricket. We thought we had a powerful score, but I guess that wasn't the case. They did well to get as close as they did. We had a few opportunities at the end which we didn't take, which does hurt. We don't tell the batters anything. We just trust they know their games and if they play well then they can definitely get us in a position. We didn't' utilize the position well initially when we lost a few too many wickets at one stretch. But credit to India for standing up and not lying down at any stage and keep us on our toes. I thought our guys bowled pretty well. We missed a few times, but that is the nature of ODIs, and it hurt when it did. There was a bit of sloppiness in there, but it is hard to fault what was a brilliant game of cricket. Hamish was great. He has had much publicized issues with injury, but the way he came back and bowled tonight, and with good pace, he will definitely play a big part in this series.

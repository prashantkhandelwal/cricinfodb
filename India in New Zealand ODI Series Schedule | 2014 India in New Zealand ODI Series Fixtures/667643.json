It was outstanding to get the total we did, and that too in a reduced game. We needed all those runs against India's packed batting. Prior to the weather I thought the batting was outstanding with Ross and Kane. Then Corey came back in today and showed just how much he has learned at this level to give us that momentum going into the second innings. Against the Indian team you know how dangerous their batting is. The team has really stepped up and performed well over these last two games. At the end of the day, under pressure, the guys did really well. In big moments he is really stepping up (Corey), and the way he came back with the ball showed his ability. Really pleased with the guys' performance, and I know we will get better and better as the series wears on."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>MS Dhoni, India captain</b>: The NZ fast bowlers, when they bowled the slower ones, it was hard to get them away. It was quite difficult to hit them away consistently, and in the end we couldn't get close to the 290 we needed. The last game I got out, and this game Virat got out, so it was important to keep continuing to build a partnership as it is hard for the players coming in to play their strokes freely. From the 25th/26th over we should have started to hit out, but it doesn't always go to plan. Yes the fast bowlers did well for us. Bhuvi was good at the death, while Shami has been performing quite consistently. We gave away a few extra runs but that is to be expected with the big hitters they have.

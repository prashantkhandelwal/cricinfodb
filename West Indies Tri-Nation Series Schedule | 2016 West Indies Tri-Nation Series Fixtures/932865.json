The crowd is stunned, what a shame! Morkel delivers a full ball angling into middle, Pollard uses his wrists to whip it over the infield.

You had to be brave to predict West Indies would win this by 100 runs when they were reduced to 21 for 4 in five overs after being sent in to bat on a lively surface. Kagiso Rabada breathed fire, but the counter-attacking record fifth-wicket stand between centurion Darren Bravo and Kieron Pollard set things up for the bowlers. In the chase, Jason Holder, mindful of a hamstring niggle, bowled out, but it was Shannon Gabriel and Sunil Narine, slowly returning to his best, who thwarted South Africa's designs. They needed AB-Faf-Duminy to make bulk of the contribution along with a quick start from Quinton de Kock. Unfortunately, that wasn't to be. West Indies were thoroughly professional and deserve a berth in the final, although there is scope to argue that they conceded bonus points in the games they lost."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b> Jason Holder: </b> I wanted to get onto the park for this game, because it was important for West Indies cricket.

Australia is No. 1 for a reason, we just have to play a good game and follow our processes.

Rabada was bowling fast, I think he's one of the fastest I've played against. It's great to beat a team that's ranked higher than us. We're playing the best team in the world in the final, hopefully we can give a good account of ourselves."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b> AB de Villiers: </b> We had a couple of opportunities to run through them, and that is where we stumbled first.

5<br>\nWin, without bonus point - 4<br>\nTie or No Result - 2<br>\nLoss - 0\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points, the right to play in the final match or series will be determined as follows:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The team with the most number of wins\n<li>If still equal, the team with the most number of wins over the\nother team(s) who are equal on points and have the same number of wins\n<li>If still equal, the team with the highest number of bonus points\n<li>If still equal, the team with the highest net run rate\n</ul>\n\nIn a match declared as no result, run rate is not applicable.\n\n21.9.2 Net Run Rate\n\nA team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\n\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\n21.9.3 Bonus Points\n\nThe team that achieves a run rate of 1.25 times that of the opposition shall be awarded one bonus point. A team's run rate will be calculated by reference to the runs scored in an innings divided by the number of overs faced. Refer <a href=\"/db/DOWNLOAD/100/0119/appendix6.pdf\">Appendix 6</a>.\n\n21.9.4 Final Match or Series\n\nIf no result is achieved in a final the match shall be declared drawn. In the event of a drawn final, the prize money will be shared\nequally between the two competing

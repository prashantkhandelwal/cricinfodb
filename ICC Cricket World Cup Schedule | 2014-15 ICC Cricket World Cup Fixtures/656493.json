We started okay but they bowled well, they got the reverse swing going. We were happy with where we were at the start of the tournament. We got off to a very good start, Shikhar's dismissal was slightly on the softer side, at a time when we could have had the bowling under pressure. Didn't really need to play a big shot. But you get pressure chasing 300+, makes you do things you don't want to do. There was too much [for me to do], our lower order can't contribute too much in these conditions. Most of the good teams bat quite deep. Not sure [about next World Cup], I'm 33, I'm still running, still fit. Next year, T20 World Cup, will be time to decide about 2019 or not. [Players improved?] Rahane is one, right through the Tests, ODIs, he's improved his batting a lot. I would like to thank the fans, at the end of the day when you play cricket you want people to come and watch, we've been here four months and the fans are travelling all over.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"And here's <b>Michael Clarke</b>, Australia's beaming captain, after giving MS a hug: \"Obviously really excited, the boys played some outstanding cricket, Smithy's hitting the ball so sweetly and I was really proud of the execution of our bowlers. A lot of the guys sacrificed themselves for the team. Thanks to MS Dhoni and the India team, they've given a lot over the summer... You asked if MS was going to be at the next World Cup, I'm sure he will be, he has a lot of cricket in him. Losing to New Zealand [in the group stage] gave us a kick up the backside, the boys have turned up to training and the results have showed that. It's a wonderful achievement, we're proud to make the final but it's going to be tough against New Zealand. We'll fly to Melbourne, recover tomorrow, speak about training. It's been a long summer, we've got a few aches, mentally ready for the final but physically a few things to sort out. They're a great team, it's always good to play New Zealand, we hope plenty of Aussies come out to support us.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>10.25pm:</b> In the end, the pressure bearing down was just too great. Australia pinned the first plus-300 total in a World Cup semi on the door and then let the scoreboard do the job for them.

So, we have the final many predicted, the two co-hosts: Australia in their seventh, New Zealand their first.

Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Pool

The guys up front are struggling a little bit. First 10 overs, in New Zealand conditions, it was seaming a little bit, they bowled really well, we could not negotiate the new ball. It's always difficult. Performances like that can dent you, damage you, we have some time, next game is nine days away. We need to really recover mentally and think about our game. This is how World Cups are. You have to pick yourself up, think about your strategies, think about where you can improve.

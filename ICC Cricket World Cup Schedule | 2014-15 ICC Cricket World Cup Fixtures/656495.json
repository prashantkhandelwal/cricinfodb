the wicket. Dharmasena has gone to the third umpire with no soft signal this time. This is a slower legcutter, nearly a yorker, really really full. Taylor looks to drive, and the ball lobs to Haddin's right. The umpires check on both counts: bump ball and a clean catch.

[Impact in the Powerplay] The skipper tosses you the ball and it works out like that sometimes. I thought I might not be here today, so this is an amazing feeling.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Man of the Tournament now, and it is <b>Mitchell Starc</b>, the master of the reverse-swinging yorker, heir to Wasim Akram, who picked up 22 wickets: \"Amazing tournament, some outstanding performances but to cap it off. NZ have set the standard all tournament but we led it home. I've worked really hard for a number of months now, a few series ago we sat down and to see it come to fruition it's been phenomenal. Little lucky, it was a plan Craig and I had but to see it executed. Brendon's been fantastic all tournament. The fans have been fantastic, to win in front of this many people, there's nothing like it. Going to enjoy this one for now.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Finally, the triumphant captain, on his final day in the job, <b>Michael Clarke</b>: \"Over the moon, what a tournament, Brendon and NZ deserve a lot of credit, always a tough team to beat, whenever we play them in any sport - so well done to Baz and his team, especially personally, he had an amazing performance. Thanks to every Australian and cricket supporter out there who've been behind us. The team and support staff, the support I've had since coming back into the team, they deserve to stand there with the trophy. Said we were ready mentally and we managed to get it all together physically. [No23 shirt?] Might give it back to Warney... Haven't given it much though, time is right to walk away from one-day cricket, I'll still be playing Test cricket. [Black arm bands] It's got PH on it, I'll wear it every time I play for Australia. Been a really tough few months and everyone would say we played this World Cup with 16 players. Tonight is dedicated to our little brother. Hughesy used to party as well as any of them. We're really proud, it's a wonderful achievement, to win in our own backyard in front of family and friends.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>9.10pm:</b> The men in yellow stream out on to the pitch, engulfing Smith. Big brother has prevailed and Australia can forget about 1992 - they've won the World Cup on home soil. For the fourth time in five, too. After the disappointment of 2011, they are a mean one-day machine again. New Zealand won a whole lot as well at this tournament, in terms of admiration and affection from beyond their own shores, but they came up short across the ditch.

Aaron Finch is chuffed to win in front of his home crowd, as you would expect. And Shane Warne has Smiffy alongside him: \"Unbelievable feeling. We said we wanted to play out best games at the end of the tournament. To win three down is amazing... The bowlers set it up for us. Thanks for everyone coming out.\" He's with Mitchell Starc, whose spearing of Brendon McCullum after three balls was a huge tone-setter in this game. It's \"topped off the summer,\" he says."},{"type":"HTML","html":"The Australians are all out there, on the pitch, having microphones shoved in front of them. Shane Watson has a word for New Zealand: \"They've been the form side of world cricket the last six months, Brendon McCullum has done an incredible job, they have match-winners through their team. We're incredibly glad to have won.\" New Zealand, of course, had already laid to rest 1992 and, as Martin Crowe <a href=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/856297.html target=new>wrote beforehand</a>, this final was always going to be the \"perfect ending\". But you can be sure they would have preferred to win."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Australia will be receiving the trophy shortly, their fifth World Cup. Two years ago, they were being whitewashed in India and going out of the Champions Trophy without a win. Lehmann has helped recapture their mojo, they'll certainly celebrate under the southern cross tonight. And at the end of the Australian summer, after the pain of Phillip Hughes' passing in November, this will also be a cathartic triumph."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":13203769,"id":13203769,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":32.06,"oversActual":32.6,"overNumber":33,"ballNumber":6,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":1,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":148,"wagonY":289,"wagonZone":5,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2016-10-06T18:06:41.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":50281,"bowlerPlayerId":49108,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":182,"totalInningWickets":3,"predictions":null,"title":"Southee to Smith","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"full again, dug out back past the bowler, mid-on busts a gut to get there and cuts it off, keep them to a single.

A bit of a send-off again, but he gets a generous applause from the full house. raises his bat to them"}],"fowOrder":7,"fowWicketNum":8,"fowRuns":171,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":41.5,"fowOverNumber":42,"ballOversActual":41.5,"ballOversUnique":41.05,"ballTotalRuns":171,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null},{"playerRoleType":"P","player":{"id":51057,"objectId":277662,"name":"CJ Anderson","longName":"Corey Anderson","mobileName":"Anderson","indexName":"Anderson, CJ","battingName":"CJ Anderson","fieldingName":"Anderson","slug":"corey-anderson","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303609.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1990,"month":12,"date":13},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["lhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lmf"],"longBattingStyles":["left-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm medium-fast"],"image":{"id":303609,"objectId":1222383,"slug":"corey-anderson-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303609.jpg","width":160,"height":201,"caption":"Corey Anderson portrait","longCaption":"Corey Anderson portrait, May 2020","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":5,"playerRoleTypeIds":[10],"playingRoles":["batting allrounder"],"headshotImage":{"id":316617,"objectId":1251249,"slug":"cj-anderson-headshot","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316617.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"CJ Anderson headshot","longCaption":"CJ Anderson headshot","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":null}}},"battedType":"yes","runs":0,"balls":2,"minutes":3,"fours":0,"sixes":0,"strikerate":0,"isOut":true,"dismissalType":2,"dismissalBatsman":{"id":51057,"objectId":277662,"name":"CJ Anderson","longName":"Corey Anderson","mobileName":"Anderson","indexName":"Anderson, CJ","battingName":"CJ Anderson","fieldingName":"Anderson","slug":"corey-anderson","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303609.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1990,"month":12,"date":13},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["lhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lmf"],"longBattingStyles":["left-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm medium-fast"],"image":{"id":303609,"objectId":1222383,"slug":"corey-anderson-portrait","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/303600/303609.jpg","width":160,"height":201,"caption":"Corey Anderson portrait","longCaption":"Corey Anderson portrait, May 2020","credit":"Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":5,"playerRoleTypeIds":[10],"playingRoles":["batting allrounder"],"headshotImage":{"id":316617,"objectId":1251249,"slug":"cj-anderson-headshot","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316617.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"CJ Anderson headshot","longCaption":"CJ Anderson headshot","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":null}}},"dismissalBowler":{"id":50483,"objectId":270484,"name":"JP Faulkner","longName":"James Faulkner","mobileName":"Faulkner","indexName":"Faulkner, JP","battingName":"JP Faulkner","fieldingName":"Faulkner","slug":"james-faulkner","imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/246100/246159.jpg","dateOfBirth":{"year":1990,"month":4,"date":29},"dateOfDeath":null,"gender":"M","battingStyles":["rhb"],"bowlingStyles":["lfm"],"longBattingStyles":["right-hand bat"],"longBowlingStyles":["left-arm fast-medium"],"image":{"id":246159,"objectId":1030005,"slug":"james-faulkner-profile","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/246100/246159.jpg","width":160,"height":200,"caption":"James Faulkner profile","longCaption":"James Faulkner player profile","credit":"IDI/Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":null},"countryTeamId":2,"playerRoleTypeIds":[11],"playingRoles":["bowling allrounder"],"headshotImage":{"id":316610,"objectId":1251242,"slug":"jp-faulkner-headshot","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316610.png","width":600,"height":436,"caption":"JP Faulkner headshot","longCaption":"JP Faulkner headshot","credit":null,"photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":null,"WIDE":null,"SQUARE":null}}},"dismissalFielders":[{"player":null,"isKeeper":0,"isSubstitute":0}],"dismissalText":{"short":"bowled","long":" b Faulkner","commentary":"Corey Anderson b Faulkner 0 (2b 0x4 0x6 3m) SR: 0"},"dismissalComment":[{"type":"HTML","html":"James Faulkner.

Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.\nWhere a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Pool

That affected me and I wanted to play like that and then I started timing the ball and it all came off. Watching the ball is very important., Get to know your own game, play within your weaknesses and strengths and wait to play to your strenghts. I dont see it as a risk. I read the situation, I try to read the bowler and I understand my own momentum and I earn the right to go after the bowlers. I didn't know that, Should have got it at the Wanderers [Fastest 150]. The bounce of the ball went my way, but I'm sure West Indies will bounce back\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Very enjoyable day. I like to focus on the team, Really good performance after the MCG performance,\" continues AB, \"Our top three are natural players, they assess conditions very well. They did it perfectly today, Rilee came in and injected momentum and I followed. Its about understanding you wont carry the momentum through the 100 overs and playing around that. Very happy with Farhaan, he asked me if he had to give me singles and I just said play your game and he hit a six next ball. Tahir has great control and variations. had some stomach problems last night, had a rough night and Doc gave me an injection and I was on my way. Like sea food, love pasta and pizza\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"\"Did pretty well early on, keeping the run-rate down,\" says <b>Jason Holder</b>, \"But AB took the game away from us. If you take away his innings, it looked a totally different score. We dropped chances, and chasing 400 was always tough. But had we held on to some of those chances, we could have had 350 to chase and could have had the chance. Our death bowling need to be looked at. Just need to take the positives from today and go on to India. Need to put it behind us, but need to correct the errors moving forward. Still up for the quarter finals.

Good camaraderie from both teams as they shake hands. Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis weathered a sluggish pitch and some very disciplined West Indies bowling. Then Rilee Rossouw injected momentum with some impressively calculated ball-striking. Made a case for himself to be a permanent man in the XI. Then AB de Villiers simply thumped them. He ran like mad, he hit like a man possessed and he just defied description once he got going. Almost made the bowling not matter, but Kyle Abbott did his team a huge favour by removing Chris Gayle for 3 and then Marlon Samuels for 0. Even Jason Holder's fifty - although an impressive innings by its own - mattered very little in the context of the match. West Indies can only push this match as far away out of mind as possible and come back.

I'm really happy I contributed in all three departments. I'm really happy with my decision. Just like my Test retirement, one morning I woke up, on the 25th, and realised this was the time to go. I discussed it with my wife and other people. There is also no cricket for almost six months after this and it's a good time for giving youngsters a chance. If a youngster can take Sri Lankan cricket forward and score some runs, I'll watch it at home and be happy. When I started in 1999 I was a youngster. Every moment I wanted to do something for the side. If I failed in batting, I wanted to bowl or contribute in some other way. Even today I didn't feel I'm old but I've taken this decision and I'm happy. It's not easy after a 17-year career. I want to thank my wife, she has supported me throughout and I want to especially thank my family members too. Around 2008 the selectors dropped me, not taking me to Australia tour. Then I thought I could do more in the side. I called Mahela, the captain at that time, and said don't pick me as middle-order batsman and pick me as an opener. He said, \"ok, so go and open in domestic competition.\" In the first game I scored 190 and finished 30 or 40 overs in mot matches. Then I went to Pakistan and scored well. Since then I have continued to bat at the top. I'm happy with every decision I took. The Dilscoop I first tried in 2008 in South Africa against Australia because I knew nobody could stand behind the wicketkeeper, it's frustrating for them. I practiced it and then played it in the 2009 World Cup against Watson and I'm happy there's one shot named under me."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Mathews</b>: We were about 20-30 runs short. We have so many bowlers who can bat but we didn't have anyone partnering Chandimal. We could have dragged the game a bit towards 45 overs and build from there but our shot selection was poor. Hats off to our bowlers for bowling like that, they bowled their hearts out. Unfortunately we couldn't win this for Dilshan. He has done great service to Sri Lankan cricket and I'd like to congratulate him for that career."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Bailey is the Man of the Match</b>: We lost a couple of early wickets but fortunately our bowlers had done a good job to restrict them. It was a lightening fast outfield. I'm certainly not stepping into Smith's role and we all need to pull our weight a little bit more. We have to try something different here (sweeps and reverse sweeps), touch wood its going ok."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Warner</b>: It's always good to start on a winning note and go 2-1 up. I think our bowlers bowled really well in the middle overs - Zampa and Hastings. To be brutally honest, we should have won that five wickets down. Our top order hasn't done as well as we would've liked and I also put my hand up for that."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Some felicitation and gifts for Dilshan for his ODI farewell.

He gets handshakes from opponents, from team-mates, a few words and a big smile from Lehmann, and in the end he takes his cap off and waves to the crowd. He goes for a lap around the ground with a stump in his hand, waving to the crowd and bowing to them in parts. He didn't have a bad game after all, 42 runs and a superb diving catch at point."},{"type":"HTML","html":"227, not a stiff target and Australia's middle order was batting sensibly to cruise them past Sri Lanka's total before the wobble conjured up some nervous and scary moments in the end. The chase was mainly lead by the composed head of Bailey, supported by Head and Wade. Had Wade, Bailey and Faulkner not fallen within four overs, they would have won by four or five wickets. Credit to Sri Lanka for fighting right till the end. Aponso, Dilruwana and Prasanna kept going one after another, creating some opportunities but 226 is always tough to

We are planning and so far, it has been very good for us (Fakhar and me). Me and Babar were talking about getting a good partnership. If we got out, it would be difficult for the middle order.

Then, the way Rizwan played and the way Shadab finished - it got us up to 280. The bowlers were also outstanding. Shadab and Nawaz started well but unfortunately Nawaz got hit. Agha bowled nine overs and that was outstanding. In ODIs, we are trying to chase 350 and trying to defend 300 as well. That is what we are trying to do day by day. Focus is now to not relax and come out strongly for the next two matches. (On bench strength) We tried to do it in the second game and we tried communicating that. We did that in T20Is as well and hopefully we can do that moving forward, with back-to-back series. Hopefully we can continue to give our 100%."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>Tom Latham, New Zealand captain:</strong> It (the pitch) probably slowed up a little bit. Just a couple of partnerships here and there, and things could have been a little different. We struggled a touch in the middle. At the half-way mark, we were happy and the bowlers certainly improved after the first two games. From a batting point of view, we had a really good start. We just could not continue that momentum after we lost a couple of wickets. When you are chasing scores like that, you need back-to-back partnerships. We were not quite at our best (from a batting point of view) today."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<strong>11:26pm</strong> That turned into a fairly comfortable victory for Pakistan in the end. That, though, did not seem to be the case when New Zealand's openers were going strong. Once Young fell, courtesy of some brilliant Pakistan fielding, the hosts established a foothold. Their spinners tightened the screws and it built pressure on the Kiwis."},{"type":"HTML","html":"That pressure told as Blundell ran himself out and Mitchell perished trying to clear the fence. Latham tried his best to take the game deep but without much support from his middle order, departed in the 42nd over. McConchie, on debut, notched up a fifty and played a few attractive strokes. The Black Caps, however, were well behind in the game by then."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Pakistan, meanwhile, would be pleased with how they bowled.

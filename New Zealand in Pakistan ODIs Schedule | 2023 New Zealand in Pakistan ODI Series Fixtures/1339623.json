They stemmed the flow of runs in the first phase of the innings, which forced Pakistan's top order to play jailbreak shots as the asking rate kept climbing up. Henry took the first wicket by getting the better of Shan Masood, and then Shipley got the vital scalps of Babar and Rizwan. Rachin bowled exceptionally well as he has throughout this series, getting rid of the in-form Fakhar Zaman.

Apart from Iftikhar Ahmed's staggering unbeaten 94 and Salman Agha's quickfire half-century, nobody else stuck around for long enough to make this game more interesting and take it down to the wire.

In Karachi, we were surprised that there weren't as good batting conditions as we expected while batting second but you have to perform no matter what the conditions are. I think we should have played better cricket. New Zealand bowled well tonight. Overall, the series was good, there were good performances and many positives.

Full delivery outside off stump. Nicholls looks to fetch it and paddle it fine. He gets a bottom edge that then pops up off the boot and nestles into Rizwan's gloves. The only question here is whether the ball hit the boot on the full and lobbed up. If that is the case, Nicholls, as disappointed as he looks, will have to walk back! The third umpire has been called into action, although the soft signal is out. Looks like it has come flush off the boot, and that brings Nicholls' stay to an end!"}],"fowOrder":1,"fowWicketNum":2,"fowRuns":83,"fowBalls":null,"fowOvers":16.6,"fowOverNumber":17,"ballOversActual":16.6,"ballOversUnique":16.06,"ballTotalRuns":83,"ballBatsmanRuns":0,"videos":[],"images":[],"currentType":null},{"playerRoleType":"P","player":{"id":67178,"objectId":547749,"name":"WA

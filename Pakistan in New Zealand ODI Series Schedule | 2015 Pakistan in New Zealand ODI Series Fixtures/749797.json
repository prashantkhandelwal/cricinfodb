but to give it the kitchen sink, which he does as it appears he may have had an edge on it as it passed through. Misbah decides to go for the <b>review</b> despite the initial not out call from the umpire. Doesn't appear to be any mark on the bat from HotSpot. Was a noise as the ball went past the blade though. There is some activity on Snicko too. Would be helpful to get a better angle of it though. The final decision comes through and it looks like the decision has been reverse as Luke is given his marching orders. Luke, in disbelief at the decision, finally accepts and walks off, much to the dismay of the Napier crowd who were hoping for some bonus fireworks from the

He's got this oldish ball to nip away from a full length. Was that reverse swing or a good old offcutter? In any case, it was Nehra at his crafty best. Replays indicate it was an offcutter. He bustles in from over the wicket, lands it full and outside off, inviting the drive and then moving off away towards the off side. The deviation is enough to induce an outside edge as Cooper goes for the big cover drive. Dhoni holds the low catch easily.

Best spinner in this team? He's done in Netherlands' best batsman with a bit of old-school left-arm spinner's guile. He's got this to dip on RTD after inviting him out of the crease for the loft down the ground. RTD did not realise he wasn't to the pitch of it, until too late, and decided to go through with the shot. He was looking to go leg side, but the extra spin meant that it went off the lower half of the bat, getting a bit of outside edge in the process. He ended up scooping it higher than he wanted, compromising for distance, and playing to towards long off as the bat turned in his hand.

its presence felt. Anil Kumble would have called that a flipper, but this is Chawla's googly, it is generally shorter in length than the leggie, and skids along with the angle, with slight inward turn. The delivery's hopes of striking hinge on the batsman's propensity to cut. Eric did just that, ambitiously setting himself up for the square cut by getting back and looking to come down on it. He saw it sliding in and tried to arrest the shot and cover the line. Too late. The ball hurries through and thuds into middle and leg.

RTD did not realise he wasn't to the pitch of it, until too late, and decided to go through with the shot. He was looking to go leg side, but the extra spin meant that it went off the lower half of the bat, getting a bit of outside edge in the process.

tied, the teams shall compete in a one over per side eliminator to determine which team progresses to the semi-final. Refer to Appendix 7. <a href=\"/ci/content/download/498165.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\n\n<li>If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the one over eliminator from being completed, or if the match is a no result, then the team that finished in the higher position in the Group stage shall proceed to the semi-finals.\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<b>Semi Final</b>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If a Semi-Final is tied, the teams shall compete in a one over per side eliminator to determine which team progresses to the final.

Refer to Appendix 7. <a href=\"/ci/content/download/498165.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. If weather conditions prevent the one over eliminator from being completed, the teams will be declared joint winners.\n\nIn the event of a no result, provided weather conditions permit, the teams shall compete in a one over per side eliminator to determine which team is the winner. If weather conditions do not permit, the teams will be declared joint winners.\n\n<p>\n<b>Net Run Rate</b>\n\nA team‟s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nNote: Any play during a one over per side eliminator is excluded from these calculations.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2‟s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team‟s refusal to play, either by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that the full 50 overs of the defaulting team‟s innings in such forfeited match shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs per over of the defaulting team over the course of the relevant portion of the competition. For the avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such forfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the net run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"Group

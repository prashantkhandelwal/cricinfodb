It has been worrying and frustrating. I know this is just one game, but it is a step in the right direction. I know the public in South Africa wants consistency, and we will work on that. I am proud the way bowlers came out and worked in partnerships, picking up wickets at regular intervals. Rory is a very mature performer. he knows his game inside-out.

We were looking at 270-280; it could have been a good game then. We need to work a little bit on death bowling and fielding. Too many easy balls and fielding lapses today. We can improve.

Hafeez is well short. Although we have had many replays, and I have no doubt the ball hit the ring finger of Kleinveldt's hand. I think Billy Bowden is not sure beyond all reasonable doubt.

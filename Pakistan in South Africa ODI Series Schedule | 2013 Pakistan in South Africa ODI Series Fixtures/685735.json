many well-wishers and supporters, who after the previous series in the UAE would probably not have fathomed such a result. A visibly buoyant Pakistan team pose with the series trophy as the sun sets on what has been a successful tour for the tourists. They now embark for the tour of Sri Lanka, which is set to begin on December 11, while South Africa have just five days before India arrive to play the first ODI on December 5. So plenty of cricket to look forward to in the next few weeks. On behalf of Gopi, the scorer, and Abhishek Purohit, this is Rohan Sharma hoping you enjoyed today's coverage of the third and final ODI in South Africa. Ciao!"},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan captain</b>: Already said in the second game as it was much needed to win this series. Have had a lot of youngsters coming in and performing, especially after losing the home series in UAE. Really happy with how everyone played, and even though I am a bit disappointed with today, there is a lot we achieved on this tour. We have so many choices in the bowling department. Irfan can bowl well and take wickets, along with all the allrounders. If you have choices like that then you can really go for it. This should help us in the Sri Lanka tour. Winning here in South Africa also helps us mentally. Pressure was on but I know in cricket that these things happen. Sometimes you are trying everything and giving 100%, and you still lose. You have to be patient and bat well, which we have done through this series. Really happy with the way the team fought here. This is always important, especially in the sub-continent. If you want to lead the side, then you have to perform consistently. You have to perform as a leader."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Saeed Ajmal (Pak), Man of the Series</b>: I am very happy with my captain, my team-mates. They are always with me when I am bowling.

Very happy to play against South Africa."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<b>Vernon Philander (SA), Man of the Match</b>: I am enjoying the challenge at the moment. It's tough to be out of the side, but I am enjoying every moment out there. With the first new ball there is not a lot changing. As far as we can we try to strike with the new nut. I think the two new balls makes a difference as the ball stays a lot harder for a lot longer, also helped me get back into the fold again. My lengths still stay the same so I don't have to adjust too much there.

I thought we bowled exceptionally well and we adapted to conditions well this morning. It was tough to come out and bat against a world-class attack. Happy with how we stuck it through. It didn't do much this morning and we bowled really well. Have to give credit to my bowling unit for taking wickets on this pitch. It was really tough to bat out there and score. That's why it made the run chase so special for us. We need a bit more care with the partnerships. We seem to get in and get out. If we get in we have to take it deep. Another big series coming up against India. They have been playing really good cricket around the world and are No. 1 and will be a great challenge for us.

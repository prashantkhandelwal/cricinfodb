Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final target score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match)\nis awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play,\neither by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) as read\nwith playing condition 21.3 or in accordance with the provisions of\nthe relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams,\nthe net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that\nthe full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited\nmatch shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs\nper over of the defaulting team over the course of the league. For\nthe avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such\nforfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the\nnet run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.\n\n21.10.5 \n\nIn the event of any dispute the ICC Event Technical Committee may\nbe called on to make a ruling and its ruling will be

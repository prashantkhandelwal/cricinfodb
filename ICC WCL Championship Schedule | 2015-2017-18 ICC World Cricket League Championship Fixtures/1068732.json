Standings\n\n21.10.1 Round-Robin Matches\n\nThe following points system shall apply:\n\nWin - 2<br>\nTie or No Result - 1<br>\nLoss - 0\n\n21.10.2 Round-Robin Matches\n\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points at the end of the round-robin matches, the standing in the league table will be decided in the following order of priority:\n\n<ul>\n<li>i) The team with the most number of wins in the round-robin\nmatches will be placed in the higher position.\n<li>ii) If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the\nround-robin matches then in such case the team with the\nhigher net run rate in these matches will be placed in the higher\nposition (refer to 21.10.3 below for the calculation of net run rate).\n<li>iii) If, following net run rate calculations above, there are teams\nwhich are still equal, then the team which has earned more\npoints in the head to head matches played between them will\nbe placed in the higher positions.\n<li>iv) If still equal, the team with the higher net run rate in the\nhead to head matches played between them will be placed in\nthe higher position.\n<li>v) In the highly unlikely event that teams cannot be separated\nby the above this will be done by drawing lots.\n</ul>\n\nPlease note in a match declared as no result, run rate is not applicable.\n\n21.10.3 Net Run Rate\n\nA team's net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.\n\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate of both teams shall be based on the full quota of overs to which the batting team would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed.\n\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited with Team 2's Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 run less than the final target score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.\n\nIn circumstances where a match (and the points for such match)\nis awarded to a team as a result of the other team's refusal to play,\neither by the umpires in accordance with Law 21.3 (a)(ii) as read\nwith playing condition 21.3 or in accordance with the provisions of\nthe relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams,\nthe net run rate of the defaulting team shall be affected in that\nthe full 50 overs of the defaulting team's innings in such forfeited\nmatch shall be taken into account in calculating the average runs\nper over of the defaulting team over the course of the league. For\nthe avoidance of doubt the runs scored and overs bowled in such\nforfeited match will not be taken into account when calculating the\nnet run rate of the team to whom the match was awarded.\n\n21.10.5 \n\nIn the event of any dispute the ICC Event Technical Committee may\nbe called on to make a ruling and its ruling will be final.","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"available":{"tie":true,"pct":false,"draw":false,"multiSeries":false,"quotient":false,"nrr":true,"rpwr":false,"forAgainst":true},"groups":[{"name":"","teamsToQualifyCount":0,"teamStats":[{"teamInfo":{"id":15,"objectId":15,"scribeId":15,"slug":"netherlands","name":"Netherlands","longName":"Netherlands","abbreviation":"NED","unofficialName":null,"imageUrl":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/313100/313136.logo.png","isCountry":true,"primaryColor":null,"image":{"id":313136,"objectId":1241595,"slug":"netherlands-logo","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/313100/313136.logo.png","width":500,"height":500,"caption":"Netherlands

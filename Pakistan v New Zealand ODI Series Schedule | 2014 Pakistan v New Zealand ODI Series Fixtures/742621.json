Williamson stayed solid through a mid-innings wobble and stayed unbeaten till the end. Pakistan would probably look back to the start of their innings in the afternoon. They won the toss, but lost their first three wickets cheaply. It was a catch-up game from there on. New Zealand's seamers were terrific today. They bowled to a plan, bowled with pace, and bowled short to share the ten wickets between them, quite an achievement given the placid nature of the pitch.

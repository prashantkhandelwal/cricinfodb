Paul Stirling their hero again with a well-paced one-day innings. He was willing to grind it out after the loss of Ed Joyce and his captain William Porterfield. His innings once again highlights the importance of strike rotation, especially on a slow pitch like this, where scoring big isn't always easy. It is something Afghanistan do not do very well, and there is probably something to learn for them from this defeat. Stirling played time, pinched the singles, tried to build a partnership before going for his shots. He was very unfortunate to miss out on a century, but he will not mid that one bit as his effort has come in a match-winning cause.

On the slow side but a pretty good wicket, it was about getting a partnership together, there wasn't scoreboard pressure, kept driving that home and making it as big as possible.

They suffocated us in the middle overs, the spinners bowled well in partnership. [Too many changes?] Not the batting order, we thought Dinesh was going well, with the bowling we felt Bhuvi has the experience and was good to come back in, but it didn't come off. When it doesn't come off, changes look unnecessary. We need to move on and improve as a side. Every side is looking for the best balance possible, these losses will tell us what we need to work on.

Guys make my decisions look good. Like any captain, you're only as good as your team, guys were brilliant today. Off the mark at Trent Bridge, India punished us. [Kuldeep?] A completely different challenge for us, but satisfying that we learnt, went through the process of looking at our plans.

Back-to-back hundreds for Joe Root, he goes past Marcus Trescothick's long-standing record of 12 for England in ODIs. A serene partnership of 186 between Root and Eoin Morgan put to bed any thoughts that this could be a tricky chase; India's spinners were wicketless and England have their one-day mojo back. An eighth bilateral series win in a row (excluding the one-off loss to Scotland), and confirmation that they will be a formidable prospect at home in next year's World Cup. A total of 256 was clearly below par, England bowling well up front after winning the toss and then strangling the game with spin - but even then, it was a surprise to see the chase dealt with so insouciantly. There might be questions about India's selection, too, which contributed to a rare ODI series defeat, their first since the Australia tour of 2015-16. Anyway, after six white-ball matches, it's England 3-3 India: which all sets things up rather nicely for the Tests, I reckon."},{"type":"HTML","html":"<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/video/clip?id=24122720\" target=\"_blank\"><b>WATCH Joe Root brings up a record-breaking 13th ODI century for England with the last hit of the game</b></a> (India only)"}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":25327577,"id":25327577,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":44.03,"oversActual":44.3,"overNumber":45,"ballNumber":3,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":1,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2018-07-17T18:39:58.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":52656,"bowlerPlayerId":70633,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":256,"totalInningWickets":2,"predictions":null,"title":"Hardik to Root","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"now Pandya sticks it into the tramlines, another wide and <b>scores are level</b>"}],"commentPostTextItems":null,"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":25327575,"id":25327575,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":44.02,"oversActual":44.2,"overNumber":45,"ballNumber":2,"totalRuns":0,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2018-07-17T18:39:25.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":52656,"bowlerPlayerId":70633,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":255,"totalInningWickets":2,"predictions":null,"title":"Hardik to Root","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"fired full and wide, swing and a miss"}],"commentPostTextItems":null,"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":25327573,"id":25327573,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":44.01,"oversActual":44.1,"overNumber":45,"ballNumber":1,"totalRuns":2,"batsmanRuns":2,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":307,"wagonY":280,"wagonZone":3,"timestamp":null,"modified":"2018-07-17T18:39:02.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":52656,"bowlerPlayerId":70633,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":255,"totalInningWickets":2,"predictions":null,"title":"Hardik to Root","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Four to win...

Angelo Mathews offered some resistance, but that was no consolation, for it simply delayed the inevitable. As for India, who rode magnificent tons from Rohit and Kohli earlier in the day, this was another proper workout. Shardul Thakur, on ODI debut, was zippy and impressive with the new ball. Axar Patel had a rough day, but with little pressure on the bowlers, India didn't need to look for a Plan B. For fans who demand better from Sri Lanka, this will be another bitter pill to swallow.

players selected as the Men of the Match, but it would have been tough to decide between the two as they both played equally decisive parts in this New Zealand victory. It was a memorable day for you stats fanatics as Ronchi pummeled the highest score by a No. 7 in ODI history, and the unbeaten 267-run sixth-wicket stand he shared with Elliott was the highest ever. Well that is it from the University Oval in Dunedin. We will be back here in just a couple of days' time for the sixth ODI. We sincerely hope you will be able to join us for that.

It was good for both of us. We worked off each other, and we tried to be as relaxed as we could. Once things started flowing along we began to relax and have good fun out there. Ronchi doesn't get a lot of time at the end so it was nice for him to come in early and show how destructive he can be. It brings good confidence to the team to be able to come back from 90 for 5 and kick on from there.

But it didn't turn and our fast bowlers didn't really get it in the right area. We could have used another fast bowler which is why I bowled seven overs. The ball didn't turn so that was a mistake for us. Dilshan played really well for us. He has been scoring runs for us since the first match. We planned yesterday for me to open the batting but we have to get more responsibility as the three senior players are going really well.

We let SL dictate the game early on, so there is room for improvement there. Incredible batting performance from Luke and Elliott. Amazing how they got us to 360-odd. It didn't feel easy earlier on as they got the ball to seam around and move, but once it lost that it became easier to bat on. From 90-odd for 5 we had two guys step up and produce one of the best partnerships you will ever see in ODIs. Different guys stood up today, as Trent bowled really well with the new ball. Thought Tim was very good with the new ball as well. Thought Mitch came back really well, he needs to work at the start of his spell though, but he is becoming an instrumental part of the team.

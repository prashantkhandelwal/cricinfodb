The aim was to take it as deep as possible give us the best chance towards the end. I don't think I hit the targets where I wanted to but happy to just bat as deep as I possibly could there. The team really needed me. They bowled well, must commend their bowlers, especially their spinners, they stuck to their task well. We batted well in that period to overcome their spin threat.

However, they struggled against the likes of Holder, Joseph, Mayers and then later Akeal spun a web around the batters. It's a massive learning curve for them playing against an experienced side and they almost batted through 50 overs. They were able to peg West Indies back with the ball in the bowling powerplay after winning the toss and got early wickets too but then Nicholas Pooran and Shai Hope took control of the game and forged a colossal 216-run partnership."},{"type":"HTML","html":"Elina Poudel: \"The past few years of busy cricket engagements with associate nations have propelled Nepal's cricket to its current level.

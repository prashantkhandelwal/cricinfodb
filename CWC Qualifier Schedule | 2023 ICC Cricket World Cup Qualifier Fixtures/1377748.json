That's a key area we could have done better. That's the key to success. I would like to see my two fast bowlers getting wickets up front with the movement. Today we got a wicket with a short ball. We could have bowled in that right area a bit and got a couple of wickets. I think that's the key. And Hasaranga, we know he is going to do the job always.

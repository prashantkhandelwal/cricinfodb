Earlier, Stirling showed his class and went berserk with the bat, scored 162 to help his side post an above par total. When Stirling has these kinds of days, there's not much you can do about it. He was devastating from the word go and led the charge, as if he was doing catharsis after Ireland once again, second time in a row, will miss out the World Cup but they finish their campaign on a high with a convincing win.

I think there was a lot of passion coming into this competition. Just want to go home with a smile on face. It's been a tough tournament.

stage, then in such case the\nteam with the higher net run rate in all matches played against the other Super Six qualifiers will\nbe placed in the higher position <br>\n\n<b>c)</b> If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head-to-head match(es)\nplayed between them (points then net run rate in those matches).<br>\n\n<b>d)</b> If still equal, any teams that

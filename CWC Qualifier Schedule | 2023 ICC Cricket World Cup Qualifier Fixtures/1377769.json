It was very well followed up by that partnership by Brandon and Matthew Cross. (On their bowling preparation) We have been really clear with our plans. Guys have been feeling good and confident. Makes it easier when you have lots of options. Since Brandon has come in…he is still very early in his career but he has had some fantastic performances. He was pretty happy today to keep going (for nine overs straight). A very special talent. (On the match against Zimbabwe) Should be another great game. All to play for still. Two important points on the line, so should be a good test against them at home in Bulawayo. (On the transition period after the retirement of key players) Things have gone pretty well for us in the last year or so. missing two players like Kyle (Coetzer) and Callum (MacLeod) is huge.

The toss is always crucial but we need to find a way to counter that early movement. (On the fielding) I probably have to say the mindset. It really has to do with the attitude, we need to put in a much better effort. The effort needs to remain, regardless of what has happened. We did it in patches but we certainly need to improve on that. (What is the way forward) The preparation needs to be better. We cannot come here and expect to be an elite team without preparation. Cannot expect to wake up one morning and be a great team. We know there is two more games left, we need to find a way to bounce back. (On if there is enough talent in the Caribbean) There is no question about it. We need to make sure we transfer that talent into consistent performances. (On Scotland) They played really well.

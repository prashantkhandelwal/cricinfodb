Ireland's hopes are dashed as this resounding victory from Sri Lanka paves the way for Scotland and Oman to reach the Super Six stage. The early departure of their swashbuckling opening batter Stirling and then their lynchpin Balbirnie were major blows. Thereon, Ireland could never really recover from that early jolt.

Mark Adair was the pick of the bowlers for Ireland, returning figures of 4/46 while Gareth Delany kept things quiet in his spell, conceding 52 runs in his 10 and chipped in with two scalps. Barry McCarthy leaked 62 in nine overs and snapped up three wickets. In reply, Ireland didn't have answers to the probing stuff and succumbed to the scoreboard pressure.

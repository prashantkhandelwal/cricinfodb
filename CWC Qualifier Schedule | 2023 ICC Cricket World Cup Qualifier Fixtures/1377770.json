Credit to the other teams; they played really well in the tournament. Some other teams gave us some good fights but still, we are the better side. To be honest, these bunch of players, they have got their own skill, and they utilized the conditions really well over here. We stick to our basics whatever the condition, whatever the situation is. We want to play the hardest as much as we can. That is what's important. Not going to take it lightly against West Indies, so we are going to give our maximum over there as well. It's a big achievement (to qualify for the World Cup) but still, you know what we have done in the past in World Cups...we hold the 1996 World Cup, runners-up in 2011 and we have been playing amazing cricket in the World Cups.

Actually, this win boosts our confidence, we knew how good we are and our plan was to win all games.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Theekshana was miserly once again and didn't let Zimbabwe get off the hook after Madushanka's hostile opening burst that prised out three wickets in the powerplay; he had the new ball hooping around and offered no leeway to the openers. The match inexorably headed one way after a brilliant bowling performance from Sri Lanka and a pretty underwhelming show with the bat from the tournament's hosts. While Hasaranga was somewhat neutered by relentless sweeping, Theekshana continued to discombobulate the batters throughout his spell as the innings began to peter out and Zimbabwe were unable to shield their stumps. The move to dominate the spinners in the middle overs backfired. They could have given themselves a good chance by batting through the fifty overs but they threw the caution to the wind against Theekshana - who was breathing fire, hitting the right areas with unbelievable accuracy and extracting spin and bounce on this tricky pitch. It turned out to be a proper thrashing in the end that Zimbabwe didn't face before this game as they had been fiercely competitive in this tournament. They will go back to the drawing board and work on devising more effective strategies against potent bowling line-ups like the one they faced today."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[{"id":363245,"objectId":1385396,"slug":"pathum-nissanka-brought-up-a-quick-century","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363200/363245.jpg","width":1400,"height":940,"caption":"Pathum Nissanka brought up a quick century","longCaption":"Pathum Nissanka brought up a quick century, Zimbabwe vs Sri Lanka, Men's World Cup Qualifier, Super Six, Bulawayo, July 2, 2023","credit":"ICC/Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363200/363245.jpg","WIDE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363200/363245.6.jpg","SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363200/363245.10.jpg"},"dateTaken":"2023-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","capturedOn":{"year":2023,"month":7,"date":2}}],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":43175613,"id":43175613,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":33.01,"oversActual":33.1,"overNumber":34,"ballNumber":1,"totalRuns":1,"batsmanRuns":0,"isFour":false,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":1,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":0,"wagonY":0,"wagonZone":0,"timestamp":"2023-07-02T12:36:56.000Z","modified":"2023-07-02T12:36:59.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":93033,"bowlerPlayerId":67884,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":165,"totalInningWickets":1,"predictions":null,"title":"Masakadza to Nissanka","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Half-tracker and lands it outside the tramlines on off, scores are level"}],"commentPostTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"Ankur Saxena: \"Masakadza was in no mood to see Nissanka reach his 100.Nissanka I thought read his mind the next ball.\""},{"type":"HTML","html":"Yasindu: \"32 or 16 Teams should compete in the main event.

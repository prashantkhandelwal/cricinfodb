Coming here, everyone in our team wanted to prove that we are a better side than to play the qualifiers. We wanted to put up our best performances. Only concern was injuries. Apart from that, we had full control in every game and in every situation. The top order, middle order, the bowlers - everyone performed very well. (On the spinners) For a while, I have been playing with them so I know the time when to use them. Chris and Mahela was there to support us. We prepare the plans pretty early. Even in the World Cup, they will play a big role for Sri Lanka. (On how his team dealt with pressure) There was pressure but none of the other management, or myself allowed the pressure to come to the team room. That was the best thing. The environment was really good and it helped for the mentality and eventually, the performance. (What this means to Sri Lanka) We never wanted to play a qualifier tournament and that is what the rest of the boys believe.

Pretty proud of the way the boys have played. We have played good cricket for a majority of the games and excited about the next few months. (On today) Credit to our bowlers, we kept them to a score that we felt we could chase. We had to play their spinners better and we did not do that. (On the positives from the tournament) The way the guys got around each other, the culture in the group has been amazing. Zimbabwe is a beautiful place to be and that has helped us. Our batters have been good throughout the tournament. Guys stepped up when they had to and that is why we are heading to India. (Any particular moment that was the turning point) That West Indies chase - we took a lot of confidence from that. Even chasing 280 in 44 overs, we sort of had the blueprint from that WI game. that was a turning point for us and we kept the ball rolling from there. (On what it does for Dutch cricket) It is obviously massive for our guys and for our supporters back home. The opportunity to play in a ten-team World Cup is massive for us.

As a bowling unit, we tried to bowl stump-to-stump and I tried to do the same as well. (On what he will take back from this tournament) I want to take this momentum into the World Cup in India.

At the half-way stage, it felt that they were a few runs short. But their bowlers rose to the occasion, and did so in grand fashion. Madushanka rocked the Netherlands early, picking up Vikramjit and Barresi. Hasaranga then got into the act, bamboozling Nidamanuru. Thereafter, it was a bit of a procession, with the Dutch batters simply having no answers to Sri Lanka's spinners. Theekshana, who opened the bowling, also picked up his second successive four-wicket haul and kept the batters guessing throughout."},{"type":"HTML","html":"As for the Dutch, well, they would not be happy with how this particular game has gone. But this tournament overall was definitely a success for them. They will be in India in a few months' time, playing for the prize that matters in ODI cricket and will be the only non-Test playing nation to be there. That alone tells you how gargantuan this achievement is, and do not let today's performance blur what they have accomplished in Zimbabwe."}],"commentVideos":[],"commentImages":[{"id":363720,"objectId":1386594,"slug":"the-sri-lankans-are-on-their-way-to-india-for-the-odi-world-cup","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363720.jpg","width":1400,"height":934,"caption":"The Sri Lankans are on their way to India for the ODI World Cup","longCaption":"The Sri Lankans are on their way to India for the ODI World Cup, Netherlands vs Sri Lanka, ODI World Cup qualifier final, Harare, July 9, 2023","credit":"ICC via Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363720.jpg","WIDE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363720.6.jpg","SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363720.10.jpg"},"dateTaken":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","capturedOn":{"year":2023,"month":7,"date":9}},{"id":363719,"objectId":1386592,"slug":"dasun-shanaka-lifts-the-trophy-after-leading-sri-lanka-through-an-all-win-run","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363719.jpg","width":1400,"height":939,"caption":"Dasun Shanaka lifts the trophy after leading Sri Lanka through an all-win run","longCaption":"Dasun Shanaka lifts the trophy after leading Sri Lanka through an all-win run, Netherlands vs Sri Lanka, ODI World Cup qualifier final, Harare, July 9, 2023","credit":"ICC via Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363719.jpg","WIDE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363719.6.jpg","SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363719.10.jpg"},"dateTaken":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","capturedOn":{"year":2023,"month":7,"date":9}},{"id":363722,"objectId":1386596,"slug":"the-trophy-gets-passed-around-after-sri-lanka-won-every-single-match-in-the-qualifying-tournament","url":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363722.jpg","width":1400,"height":923,"caption":"The trophy gets passed around after Sri Lanka won every single match in the qualifying tournament","longCaption":"The trophy gets passed around after Sri Lanka won every single match in the qualifying tournament, Netherlands vs Sri Lanka, ODI World Cup qualifier final, Harare, July 9, 2023","credit":"ICC via Getty Images","photographer":null,"peerUrls":{"FILM":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363722.jpg","WIDE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363722.6.jpg","SQUARE":"/db/PICTURES/CMS/363700/363722.10.jpg"},"dateTaken":"2023-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","capturedOn":{"year":2023,"month":7,"date":9}}],"events":[],"over":null,"batsmanStatText":null,"bowlerStatText":null,"smartStats":[]},{"_uid":43311547,"id":43311547,"inningNumber":2,"ballsActual":null,"ballsUnique":null,"oversUnique":23.02,"oversActual":23.2,"overNumber":24,"ballNumber":2,"totalRuns":4,"batsmanRuns":4,"isFour":true,"isSix":false,"isWicket":false,"dismissalType":null,"byes":0,"legbyes":0,"wides":0,"noballs":0,"penalties":0,"wagonX":220,"wagonY":3,"wagonZone":1,"timestamp":"2023-07-09T13:09:21.000Z","modified":"2023-07-09T13:09:24.000Z","batsmanPlayerId":106392,"bowlerPlayerId":101991,"outPlayerId":null,"totalInningRuns":105,"totalInningWickets":9,"predictions":null,"title":"Theekshana to Floyd","dismissalText":null,"commentPreTextItems":null,"commentTextItems":[{"type":"HTML","html":"full and down the leg side.
